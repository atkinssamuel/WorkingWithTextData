    "## TF/IDF\n",
    "Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) are useful data that will inform us as to which terms are the most relevant to a given document in a corpus. TF simply measures the frequency of a given word in a document. This measurement is useful because typically, common words are relevant to the meaning of that document. TF can be calculated in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$TF = OC / T$\n",
    "\n",
    "$OC$ is the total number of occurences of that particular word in the document and $T$ is the total number of words in the document. Suppose we have access to all of the articles on Wikipedia. Our corpus, in this context, is all of these Wikipedia articles combined. Each of these articles would be its own entity called a document. Document Frequency (DF) is a measure of how frequently a given word appears in the entire corpus of text. The IDF is the inverst of the DF:\n",
    "\n",
    "$IDF = \\frac{1}{DF}$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the TF and the IDF we can measure how important and unique a given word is for a particular document. Since word frequencies are distributed exponentially, we use the log of the IDF to obtain a measure for the value of a word in a given document:\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Value (WV) $= TF \\cdot log(IDF)$\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach treats the documents in a corpus as a \"bag of words\". This means that this approach does not take into account the meaning of sentences or the contexts in which these words are used in. This restricts the applications of this method severely. \n",
    "\n",
    "### TF/IDF Application\n",
    "Suppose we wish to search our Wikipedia corpus for a document most relevant to Serena Williams. We could compute the WV for \"Serena Williams\" accross all of the documents. Then, we could the set of documents that had the highest \"Serena Williams\" WVs. This would be a reasonably effective way to query a corpus for relevant documents. \n",

    "# N-Gram Models\n",

These models have a tremendous amount of use cases. They can be used to determine which word belongs in a particular sentence for the purpose of text generation. They can be used to detect spelling errors in sentences. They can also be used as speech recognition engines. \n",

    "# Text Processing for Complex Models\n",
    "## Why is Text Processing Important?\n",
    "Natural language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence in which unstructured text data is broken down into information that can be analyzed by models. Especially in the age of social media, humans commuincate online through unstructured text messages all the time. Whether it be through Twitter, private messaging platforms like Facebook Messenger, or through product reviewing interfaces like Yelp. The ability to transform these unstructured blobs of text into forms that are machines can understand opens the door to a wide variety of applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "These applications primarily fall under text classification and generative models. Text classification agents try to uncover the intent, logic, and/or meaning behind blobs of text. This model type can be implemented in all sorts of contexts. For example, as an AI that can automatically sort through text reviews to characterize the performance of a fast-food chain. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processed text can also be used as an input to generative models. These generative models learn how to commuincate by training on large blobs of processed text. These models can be used to generate speeches or converse with customers, for example.\n",
