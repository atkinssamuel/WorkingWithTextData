0,Vienna shooting: Gunman hunted after deadly 'terror' attack,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 01:36:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54786952,,"Gunmen armed with rifles have opened fire in six different locations in central Vienna, killing two people and wounding several more, police say. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called it a ""repulsive terror attack"" and said one gunman was also killed. Police were searching for at least one attacker who was still at large, the interior minister said. The shootings took place near Vienna's central synagogue but it is not yet clear if that was the target. One of the victims was killed at the scene of the shootings while a second - a woman - died later in hospital from her wounds, Mayor Michael Ludwig said. It is believed 14 other people remain in hospital, six in a serious condition. A police officer is among the injured, the interior ministry said. In pictures: Scene of gun attack in Vienna The attack happened just hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were out enjoying bars and restaurants which are now closed until the end of November. European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"". Police said the incident began near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, which is the main temple in Vienna. Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch tweeted that the synagogue was closed at the time the attack began at 20:00 (19:00 GMT). An officer guarding the synagogue was among the wounded, newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported. It was not immediately clear how many attackers took part in the shooting. Austrian media said one person had been arrested, citing the interior ministry. Footage posted on social media showed people running through the streets as gunshots rang out.  Witness Chris Zhao was in a nearby restaurant when the shooting started. He told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. We saw the ambulances... lining up. There were victims. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" As a major anti-terror operation swung into action, police urged people to avoid the area and not to use public transport. Roadblocks were set up around the city centre.  Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they had launched random checks on the border with Austria amid fears that the gunmen might head in that direction. On Twitter, Mr Kurz said ""we are experiencing difficult hours in our republic"".  ""Our police will act decisively against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism,"" he said. European leaders condemned the attack, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks. ""We the French people share the shock and grief of the Austrian people, struck this evening by an attack in the heart of their capital, Vienna. After France, a friend of ours is attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with,"" he said. Three people died in a knife attack in a church in the French city of Nice last week in what Mr Macron said was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". The UK prime minister also said the country's ""thoughts are with the people of Austria - we stand united with you against terror"" while Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we stand ready to support in any way we can"". European Council President Charles Michel called it a cowardly act that violated life and human values. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the shooting ""a heinous act"" and expressed ""solidarity"" with Austria. "
1,Covid-19: Liverpool to pilot city-wide coronavirus testing,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 03:10:31 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54786130,,"People in Liverpool will be offered regular Covid-19 tests under the first trial of whole city testing in England. Everyone living or working in the city will be offered tests, whether or not they have symptoms, with follow-up tests every two weeks or so. Some will get new tests giving results within an hour which, if successful, could be rolled out to ""millions"" by Christmas, the government says. Liverpool has one of the highest rates of coronavirus deaths in England. The latest figures show the city recorded 1,754 cases in the week up to 30 October. The average area in England had 153.  Along with the surrounding region, Liverpool was the first part of England to go into tier three restrictions. The pilot aims to limit spread of the virus by identifying as many infected people as possible, and taking action to break chains of transmission. What are the challenges of mass testing?'We are hanging by a thread' - Liverpool doctorCoronavirus: How to get a Covid testCovid-19 tests to be offered to all Redcar residents On Monday, the UK recorded 18,950 new confirmed cases of coronavirus and 136 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. A rising number of cases in recent weeks prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson to announce a national lockdown in England. MPs are set to vote on the plan on Wednesday,  Mr Johnson told the Commons there was ""no alternative"" but to introduce the lockdown - which is due to begin on Thursday - if the government was to stop the NHS from being overwhelmed. He also said ministers were planning a ""steady but massive expansion in the deployment of quick, turnaround tests"". The Liverpool pilot will start this week and will include a mix of existing swab tests and new lateral flow tests, which can provide a result within an hour without the need to use a lab. New test sites will be set up across the city, including in care homes, schools, universities and workplaces. People will be able to book online, turn up in person, or wait for an invitation from the local authority. Around 2,000 military personnel will help plan the logistics and deliver tests. Announcing the pilot, Mr Johnson said: ""These tests will help identify the many thousands of people in the city who don't have symptoms but can still infect others without knowing.  ""Dependent on their success in Liverpool, we will aim to distribute millions of these new rapid tests between now and Christmas and empower local communities to use them to drive down transmission in their areas. ""It is early days, but this kind of mass testing has the potential to be a powerful new weapon in our fight against Covid-19.""  You can spread coronavirus before you even feel sick. That's why testing everyone - symptoms or not - can be such as powerful tool for getting on top of the virus.   China has shown it is possible to test entire cities of millions of people. However, there are questions with both the tests used and the strategy as a whole.   Rapid or ""lateral flow"" tests need high levels of the virus in the body in order to work. It is not yet clear how good they are at catching people in the early stages of the infection when the virus is still taking hold.   False positives - when you don't have the virus, but the test says you do - are also a bigger problem when you test large numbers of people. One analysis suggested a twice-a-week test for six months using a test with a 1% false positive rate would lead to more than 40% of people being wrongly told they had the virus. But even a perfect test cannot change the course of Covid on its own. There is already an issue with too few people fully isolating even when they have Covid symptoms and have tested positive.  Will people isolate when they have no symptoms at all or will they even come forward for testing if it might mean missing work and pay? The UK's first attempt at city-wide testing will help find the answers.  Liverpool's city mayor Joe Anderson told the Liverpool Echo mass testing could be a ""game-changer"" for the city. He said local leaders had been working with the government on the plan, adding: ""If this goes well, it could enable us to have some semblance of a normal Christmas here in Liverpool."" Former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Newsnight that ministers should set a target date in 2021 for achieving regular testing of the whole population. ""We know then, if we do that, we can control this virus - and that is the hope that people up and down the country want,"" he said.  ""They feel a lot of despair at the moment because they can't see light at the end of the tunnel."" The national lockdown in England will last until 2 December. Elsewhere in the UK, a new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions came into force in Scotland on Monday. In Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said two households in Wales will be able to form a bubble and meet at home after the 17-day firebreak ends on 9 November. Schools in Northern Ireland have reopened after an extended half-term break, while other restrictions including the closure of pubs, bars and restaurants continue until 13 November.

2,US Election 2020: Biden and Trump make final pitches to voters,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 02:37:44 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54787441,,"US President Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger Joe Biden have spent the final hours of the White House race delivering their closing pitch to voters in critical states. Mr Biden campaigned in Pennsylvania and Ohio, as Mr Trump toured the voting battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina and Pennsylvania.   National polls suggest a firm lead for Mr Biden in Tuesday's election. But his lead is narrower in the handful of states that could decide the result. More than 98 million people have already cast their ballots in early voting, putting the country on course for its highest turnout in a century.  US election 2020: A really simple guideUS businesses brace for election unrest In the US election, voters decide state-level contests rather than an overall single national one.  To be elected president, a candidate must win at least 270 votes in what is called the electoral college. Each US state gets a certain number of votes partly based on its population and there are a total of 538 up for grabs. This system explains why it is possible for a candidate to win the most votes nationally - like Hillary Clinton did in 2016 - but still lose the election. Tuesday's vote comes amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The US has recorded more cases and more deaths than any other country worldwide, reporting more than 81,000 new infections on Sunday alone.   Top virus expert Anthony Fauci has sharply criticised the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic, drawing a rebuke from the White House on Sunday. As the nation counts down the hours to the vote, there are fears that pockets of post-election violence could break out. Businesses in the nation's capital, Washington DC, and in New York City have been seen boarding up their premises due to concerns about unrest. Meanwhile, the FBI says it is investigating after a convoy of vehicles with Donald Trump flags surrounded a bus carrying Mr Biden's campaign staff on a Texas highway last week. After a punishing schedule of rallies in six states on Sunday, President Trump was sprinting through four more battleground states on Monday. In North Carolina, he told supporters that ""next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country"". The rally was postponed from Thursday due to Hurricane Zeta.  He touted numbers that he says ""nobody even thought possible"". The US economy saw record-breaking 33% growth in the third financial quarter of this year, following a record 31% contraction in the second. But economists warn the damage inflicted by the pandemic - the biggest decline in the US economy in more than 80 years - could still take years to overcome. After North Carolina, Mr Trump headed to Scranton, Pennsylvania, the city where his opponent lived until he was 10. At a rally there he reminded his supporters that he won the state in 2016 despite polls suggesting he would lose.  The economy under Trump in six chartsFact-checking the closing days of the US electionTrump is in the fight of his political life Mr Biden also went to Pennsylvania where he was joined by singer Lady Gaga at a rally in Pittsburgh. Musician John Legend addressed voters with vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris. Where Trump and Biden stand on guns, race and climateThe women who hold the key to Trump's survival At a last-minute campaign stop in Ohio, Mr Biden repeated the core message of his campaign, telling voters that the race was about the soul of America. He said it was time for Mr Trump to ""pack his bags"", saying ""we're done with the tweets, the anger, the hate, the failure, the irresponsibility"". The race in Ohio is extremely tight. In 2016, Mr Trump won by more than eight points - currently, he has a 0.2% lead over Mr Biden, according to an aggregate of polls by RealClearPolitics. Also on Monday's itinerary for Mr Trump were rallies in Traverse City, Michigan, and Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kenosha was rocked by violent protests in August after the police shooting of a black man. In Traverse City he asked for the votes of black Americans. The great dividing line of US electionWhy racism is still a problem for the world's most powerful country His last rally of the campaign is due to be held in Grand Rapids, Michigan, before midnight. On Sunday the candidates attacked each other on two of this campaign's key themes - Covid-19 and racial tension. The president and his campaign have meanwhile indicated they will sue to block the potentially pivotal state of Pennsylvania from counting postal ballots received three days after the election. The US Supreme Court allowed a lower court ruling granting the extended deadline to stand, but several conservative justices signalled they might be open to revisiting the issue after the vote. Mr Trump tweeted on Monday that the high court decision allowing ballots to be accepted three days after election day was ""a very dangerous one"".  ""It will allow rampant and unchecked cheating and will undermine our entire systems of laws. It will also induce violence in the streets. Something must be done!"" Twitter added a warning label that the tweet might contain ""misleading"" information. Legal fights over ballots have also been unfolding in Minnesota, North Carolina and Texas. Mr Biden has already vowed to stop President Trump ""stealing"" the election. President Trump is to host an election night party inside the White House with about 400 guests invited. Up to 10,000 protesters are meanwhile expected to gather at Black Lives Matter Plaza and a park not far from the White House, according to CBS News. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will watch the election night returns in the former vice-president's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. It can take several days for every vote to be counted after any US presidential election, but it is usually pretty clear who the winner is by the early hours of the following morning. In 2016, Donald Trump took to the stage in New York at about 03:00 local time to give his victory speech in front of a crowd of jubilant supporters. What is the electoral college?How many Americans have voted early so far? But do not set your alarm clocks just yet. Officials are already warning that we may have to wait longer - possibly days, even weeks - for the result this year because of the expected surge in postal ballots. The last time the result was not clear within a few hours was in 2000, when the winner was not confirmed until a Supreme Court ruling was made a month later. Different states have different rules for how - and when - to count postal ballots, meaning there will be large gaps between them in terms of reporting results. In some states it will take weeks to get complete results. On Sunday, a report by news site Axios said Mr Trump would declare victory on Tuesday night if it looked as if he was ahead.  Mr Trump denied the report, but said that counting ballots after election day was a ""terrible thing"". Meanwhile, Mr Biden vowed to stop President Trump ""stealing"" the election. Who will be the next US president? You decideDo claims of US postal voting fraud stack up?Full coverage of the US election The two rivals have radically different policies on several key issues. On the coronavirus outbreak, Mr Trump set up a task force in January which he says has now shifted its focus to ""safety and opening up our country"". The president is also prioritising the speedy development of Covid treatments and vaccines, directing $10bn towards such projects. Mr Biden wants to set up a national contact-tracing programme, establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, and provide free coronavirus testing to all. He supports a nationwide mask mandate, which would require face coverings to be worn on federal property. What are Trump's and Biden's policies?What has Trump said about your country? On climate change, Mr Trump, being a sceptic, wants to expand non-renewable energy, and he has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord.  Mr Biden says he would immediately re-join the Paris deal, and he also wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050. On the economy, Mr Trump has pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, as well as one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Mr Biden wants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15.

3,Universities and colleges face Covid funding shortfalls,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 01:01:24 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-54780790,,"Universities and colleges in England face ""significant funding shortfalls and heightened uncertainty"" due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a report warns. The Institute for Fiscal Studies says fewer overseas students, potentially higher dropouts and high pension costs are a financial risk for universities. Further education colleges still face budget pressures, despite a £400m cash boost, says the report. In July ministers said universities could apply for emergency loans. The IFS report on education spending in England, which was funded by  the Nuffield Foundation, warns that universities could be exposed to a range of financial losses, such as falling international student numbers and more students failing to complete their degrees. ""By far the largest source of financial risk for universities is pension costs,"" it says.  ""New figures suggest the additional cost to universities of meeting existing pension promises may well be as high as £8bn, or double our previous estimate of around £4bn.""  Colleges' financial health 'fragile', say auditorsEmergency loans for universities about to go bustCan I get a refund from my university this year?More students say university not value for money Universities could only reduce this by ""taking on more risk, making further reductions in the pensions provided by the scheme, big rises in employees' contributions"" or a combination of these. But such measures are likely to be controversial - last academic year, lecturers went on strike over pensions, as well as pay and conditions. The IFS also says student numbers in further education colleges and sixth forms are likely to increase this year, partly due to rising numbers of young people and partly due to ""unusually high GCSE results"" and significant reductions in training and employment opportunities. While England's colleges and sixth forms will receive an extra £400m this year,  ""exceptional rises in student numbers could still generate a real-terms fall in funding per student"". They will also face challenges around educational catch-up, but may also ""need to expand to accommodate extra students as apprenticeship and employment opportunities dry up"", the IFS says.  The report also raises concerns about early years provision, saying settings are likely to be ""much more financially exposed, both to the second lockdown and more broadly to a rather slow and incomplete return of demand for childcare"". While early years providers ""were financially well protected"" during the first lockdown by the government's commitment to continue to fund the free entitlement hours, a reassessment of this funding in January 2021 could prove problematic for providers. Report co-author Ben Waltmann said there had been speculation in the summer that universities would need a financial bailout.  ""In the end, student numbers have held up better than expected, but universities still face financial risks from no-shows or higher-than-usual dropout, as well as reductions in other income streams,"" he said.  ""By far the biggest source of risk now appears to be the large deficit on the main university pension scheme, which has increased from £3.6bn in March 2018 to a monumental £21.5bn in August 2020, according to the latest preliminary estimate.  ""With contributions already at more than 30% of earnings, it is hard to see how a deficit on this scale, if confirmed, could be evened out without further cuts in the generosity of the scheme."" Co-author Imran Tahir said the government had made transforming further education colleges a big priority, pledging  £400m in extra funding at the 2019 Spending Review. He said this could be ""the first real-terms increase in spending per student for about a decade"".  ""However, student numbers could have risen dramatically more than expected due to a reduction in training, apprenticeship and employment opportunities, on top of population growth.  ""If there is no additional funding forthcoming, planned real-terms increases in spending per student could be mostly - if not entirely - eroded."" Geoff Barton, head of the head teachers' union ASCL, said colleges were often ""treated by the government in terms of funding as a Cinderella service"".  Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said the reduction in funding had led to ""courses being cut, support services reduced and extra-curricular activities removed for 16 to 18 year olds across the country"".  The £400m investment ""was a welcome step"", he said, ""but was only a one year deal following a decade of neglect."" "

5,Lockdown retail: 'It has been the toughest year I've ever had',"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 02:20:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54783329,,"The new lockdown in England means all ""non-essential""  retailers, such as clothing and electronics stores and tourist shops, will have to shut from Thursday. It has left many thousands of shops scrambling to adapt, we speak to some of them about how they're trying to prepare for the disruption. When Will Watts had to mothball his coastal tour business during the first lockdown, he decided to fulfil a long-held dream - opening his own fossil shop in Scarborough in Yorkshire. After nine weeks setting it up and much investment, he opened in late October and saw strong sales over the half-term break.  But cruelly, within a week the prime minister had called another national lockdown, meaning that from this Thursday Will must shut his new store to the public.  ""It has been the toughest year I've ever had,"" Will tells the BBC. ""It does make you question why you do what you do."" Some things will be easier than in the first shutdown in March - for example all non-essential shops can offer deliveries and click and collect, while the newly extended furlough scheme will up and running from day one.  And while a full list is yet to be published, it seems a slightly wider range of retailers will be allowed to stay open, with garden centres joining the usual suspects like supermarkets and food shops. All non-essential retail shops must shut from Thursday including: Clothing storesElectronics storesVehicle showroomsTravel agentsBetting shopsAuction housesTailorsCar washesTobacco Vape shops The government will publish a more detailed list in due course But, as Will points out, lockdown two falls in the vital period running up to Christmas and ""gift stuff is a big part of what we do"". ""We can do deliveries and click-and-collect but we are selling unique things that people want to see and feel before they buy,"" he says. ""When you go online you are in direct competition with Ebay and Amazon,"" he adds.  Naturally he's worried about the future, as he has just moved into a new building and has his staff to think about. ""I think we can make it but there is a slight nagging doubt that we won't.""  According to the British Retail Consortium, the forced closure of shops in November will cost about £2bn per week in lost sales as we enter the ""all-important"" Christmas period.  That's at a time when shop sales are already well below pre-pandemic levels. For Helen Sheward, who runs Gently, a chain of four gift and homeware shops in South East London, it's a big worry. ""We thought we could make up some of the losses from the first lockdown this Christmas, but we won't now,"" she says.  ""I cried all weekend after I heard the prime minister's announcement.""  Second England lockdown 'a devastating blow' Trying to compete online will not be easy, she says, but she plans to go to town on social media and use her shop windows as a marketing tool.  ""In the last lockdown the shutters were down, but this time we are going to open them every morning so people can browse through the windows. We will keep refreshing the displays to showcase the products."" Her six staff will go back on furlough, meaning she will be running the business single handed in a lockdown that she fears will last well into December.  ""It's a big ask for me - we have two kids, my husband works... But you put it in perspective and you think, we will survive and there are far more people living with much greater problems than this.""  On top of the furlough scheme, which covers 80% of employees' wages, the government is offering all shops forced to close cash grants of £3,000. However, the Federation of Small Business says this is not even enough to cover rent, let alone overheads like business rates. Many small business owners as company directors also get little by way of income support. William Skinner, managing director of Saville Row tailor Dege & Skinner, thinks the government shouldn't be closing shops at all, arguing they aren't a major source of infection with proper social distancing in place.  But he is stoical about his 155-year old business's chances: ""We've survived two world wars and we can survive this."" On the downside, he thinks passing trade in Central London will evaporate completely from already depleted levels. In addition, fewer business people will need bespoke suits for business trips due to the travel ban.  But he says the company learned valuable lessons in the first lockdown - for example its tailors can now make suits and coats easily from home, although the cutting still takes place at the shop.  The firm has also moved to an appointments-based system for fittings which he hopes can continue with the right safety precautions in place.  William furloughed 17 of his 21 staff in the last lockdown but expects the figure will be closer to 10 or 11 this time.  ""Now everyone is familiar and aware and going into it with more open eyes,"" he says of the second lockdown.   ""But the question is how long will this last? Will we get a vaccine? Will the virus peter out? I am not sure."" "

7,Covid in Scotland: PM says furlough available for future lockdowns,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:55:38 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-54778576,,"The furlough scheme will be available if there is a Covid-19 lockdown in Scotland in the future, the prime minister has suggested. Boris Johnson announced an extension of the job support scheme to 2 December as tough measures were imposed in England. Nicola Sturgeon said decisions on any Scottish lockdown may depend on when this funding would be available. Mr Johnson has now told MPs that the furlough scheme would ""continue to be available wherever it is needed"". Ms Sturgeon said this would be ""very welcome"" - but added she was ""seeking urgent confirmation from the Treasury that it will be exactly as we asked for"". What are the new Covid rules where you live? A new five-level system of coronavirus restrictions came into force in Scotland on Monday. At her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said she would ""ideally"" want to assess the impact of the latest measures before deciding whether it would be necessary to impose harsher measures. She said there were ""some encouraging signs"" that restrictions were having an impact in Scotland, with the rate of increase in cases ""slowing down"". However, she said the position remained ""very fragile"" - and that she faced a ""dilemma"" about imposing stricter measures in the short-term if there was a time limit on the furlough scheme. She said: ""I made clear last week that we might yet have to go further and we can't rule out a move to level four for all parts of the country. ""While that decision would never be easy, there is no doubt that the availability of a more extensive furlough scheme would make it slightly less difficult, because workers would have more of their wages paid. ""The decision we have to weigh up is should we take the opportunity of more generous financial support to step harder on the brakes now, to drive down infections."" She added: ""It cannot be right that the only time that additional financial support is made available is when the south of England needs to go into a lockdown. That just isn't fair given the situation we are dealing with."" The UK-wide job support scheme - which covers up to 80% of workers wages' and has supported hundreds of thousands of jobs north of the border - was extended to 2 December when Mr Johnson announced the four-week lockdown in England. However, the UK's devolved administrations complained that this ""time limited"" extension only covered the period when England is under enhanced restrictions. Wales has been in a ""firebreak"" lockdown since 23 October, and First Minister Mark Drakeford said requests to boost wage subsidies there had been repeatedly turned down. Calls for more flexibility over furlough were backed by Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross, who said in a speech on Monday morning that ""this has to be cleared up, now"". He said: ""It cannot be that furlough is not affordable when Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland or parts of Northern England need to go into lockdown - but when all of England goes into lockdown, the taps are turned on. ""We all hope that by following the guidance and doing the right thing, a second Scottish lockdown will not be necessary. ""But if it is, the UK government must treat Scotland the same way as England."" Repeatedly questioned about the matter in the Commons, Mr Johnson said that the job support scheme applied across the UK. He initially refused to be drawn about whether this could continue to be the case beyond December, should local lockdowns be needed in other parts of the UK. However, he then appeared to confirm that this would be the case when asked by Mr Ross to ""explain why it seems an English job is more important than a Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish one"". The prime minister said: ""If other parts of the UK decide to go into measures which require the furlough scheme then of course that is available to them - that applies not just now but in the future."" Pressed on the question by SNP MP Pete Wishart, he added: ""The furlough scheme will continue to be available wherever it is needed.""

8,'A mask over my mouth feels like attacker's hand',"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:40:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54779697,,"A rape campaigner is calling for government to ""educate"" the public about face-covering exemptions, as England moves into a second lockdown. Having her mouth covered still prompts traumatic flashbacks for Georgina Fallows, who was attacked and raped some years ago. And now, she feels re-traumatised by being verbally abused in public when she doesn't wear a mask. She has written to ministers with seven mental-health and disability charities. They are asking the government to promote a ""recognised badge [or] identifier to signify the wearer as exempt"". But, the letter states, a badge ""is no substitute for greater public understanding"" of why people might not be able to wear face coverings and that this reason may be invisible.  ""My attacker literally pulled me off the street and raped me,"" Ms Fallows says.  ""Having something in front of my mouth feels like his hand."" She has severe post-traumatic stress disorder and flashbacks, sometimes so extreme she has been sedated by paramedics.  And she has waived her right to anonymity in order to campaign for greater awareness.  Face coverings are mandatory in most indoor public spaces in England, including shops and public transport. But there are exemptions for people for whom ""putting on, wearing or removing a face covering"" will cause ""severe distress"".  People who cannot wear a mask because of a physical or mental illness or disability are also exempt.  There is a note that can be downloaded from the government website. But Ms Fallows is concerned it is not viewed as ""official"". And when she has shown her exemption pass after being challenged, people will often not accept it. Man with chronic asthma 'forced' to wear mask on planeSWhat are the rules on face coverings? The 30-year-old solicitor has been ""screamed at"" for not wearing a mask. And one woman accused ""people like me of killing her father"".  There are also fears the notes could be misused by people who do not have a valid reason not to wear a face covering. Ms Fallows wants government to consider backing the Hidden Disabilities charity's sunflower lanyard, which is already being used for this purpose and is widely recognised. For now, though, she avoids shops and transport wherever possible for fear of being verbally abused.  ""People think it's just a bit uncomfortable,"" wearing a mask. But for Ms Fallows, it can be a ""medical emergency"", resulting in three- or four-hour flashbacks that end with her being restrained and unconscious. And it is a problem shared by people with a range of other mental-health conditions, disabilities, autism, and Alzheimer's disease. The letter, sent to Public Health Minister Jo Churchill, Disability Minister Justin Tomlinson and former Disability Minister Penny Mordaunt, was co-signed by charities including Mind, Sense, Alzheimer's UK and Disability Rights UK.  A  Disability Rights UK survey of 350 people uncovered reports of people fearing hate crimes and feeling like prisoners in their own homes.  Difficulties wearing face coverings particularly affect people with mental-health conditions, sensory disorders and hidden disabilities such as autism, its research suggests. Widespread misinformation online has suggested face coverings can impair breathing.  The British Lung Foundation says: ""Wearing a mask does not reduce a person's oxygen supply or cause a build-up of carbon dioxide.  ""You may have read stories that say that it can - but this isn't true."" But wearing a face covering can give people a psychological perception of heightened breathlessness. And Ms Fallows says those who do not wear one ""through choice... do a genuine disservice to those who 'cannot' wear one and are exempt"". ""They make it easier for those who are sceptical of the exemptions to case aspersions on those who qualify"".  "
9,Basildon maternity unit handed 'urgent' safety deadline,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:42:53 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-essex-54752087,,"An NHS hospital where a woman bled to death in childbirth has been given an ""urgent"" deadline to keep patients at its maternity unit safe. A letter seen by the BBC reveals the Care Quality Commission (CQC) found unsafe staffing levels at the unit at Basildon Hospital throughout August. The CQC said the trust that runs it had until next Monday to implement appropriate measures. The trust said it had a ""robust improvement plan in place"". The seven-page document, sent by the CQC on 7 October, puts the Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust on notice that it has to ""implement an effective governance system"", among other measures. Consequences for missing the deadline were not stated, but the CQC said it was using its powers under the Health and Social Care Act to impose conditions on the trust's registration. The Act does allow the CQC to temporarily close health services.  The letter described how inspectors returned on 18 September and found the trust had still not dealt with serious failings it had been warned about in August, following an visit prompted by a whistleblower. It highlighted that it did not accept that some of the problems had been addressed, despite assurances from the trust that they had been.  The letter continued ""we were not assured that you effectively reviewed staffing and escalated appropriately to maintain safe staffing in the maternity unit"". Only four shifts throughout the month of in August had safe staffing levelsThe CQC was told 20 midwives had been recruited, yet subsequent documents submitted by the trust did not support thisRequired safety meetings during shift handovers did not take take placeIncidents affecting patient safety were inappropriately categorised, including one in which a woman who lost more than a litre a blood was graded ""no harm"" Babies were transferred to intensive care, yet graded as ""low"" or ""no harm""Inconsistent guidance to staff on identifying the risk of post-partum haemorrhage. A CQC visit in June found failings in six serious cases and rated the maternity unit inadequate. Its August report said lessons had not been learnt following the death of Gabriela Pintilie in February 2019.    The Essex coroner said there had been delays, confusion and a lack of leadership after Ms Pintilie, 36, lost six litres of blood while giving birth to her daughter.  The CQC said in a statement it was now taking ""action to protect the welfare of people using the service."" Clare Panniker, chief executive for Mid and South Essex NHS Foundation Trust, said it had ""taken action following [the CQC's] initial feedback to make our services better"". ""We have a robust improvement plan in place, and continue to work closely with the CQC and our regulators as we make the necessary changes and are committed to improving the quality of maternity care,"" she said. The CQC letter said the trust had until 16:00 GMT on 9 November to implement the recommended changes. Find BBC News: East of England on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

The H5N8 strain of bird flu was detected at a broiler breeders premises in Frodsham, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said. It said it was not related to the H5N2 strain found at a small farm near Deal in Kent earlier.  Public Health England (PHE) said the risk to public health was ""very low"". All 13,000 birds at the farm, which produces hatching eggs, will be culled, said Defra.  Further testing is under way to determine if it is a highly pathogenic strain and whether it is related to the virus currently circulating in Europe. The UK's chief veterinary officer Christine Middlemiss, said: ""Immediate steps have been taken to limit the risk of the disease spreading. ""This includes 3km and 10km temporary control zones around the infected site.  ""We are urgently looking for any evidence of disease spread associated with this farm to control and eliminate it."" Dr Gavin Dabrera from PHE said: ""There have never been any confirmed cases of H5N8 in humans and the risk to public health is considered very low."" A Food Standards Agency spokesperson said: ""On the basis of the current scientific evidence, avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers.

13,US election 2020: Trump and Biden pictured through the years,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:14:37 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54267454,,"President Donald Trump, 74, and Democratic challenger Joe Biden, 77, each have more than seven decades of personal and professional experience behind them. Here is a selection of photos that span their lives. Born in the wake of World War Two, in June 1946, Donald John Trump was the fourth child of New York real estate tycoon Fred Trump and Mary Anne MacLeod Trump. Despite the family's wealth, he was expected to do the most menial jobs within his father's company and was sent to a military academy at age 13 after he started misbehaving in school. He attended the University of Pennsylvania and became the favourite to succeed his father in the family business after his older brother, Fred, opted to become a pilot. Joseph Robinette Biden Jr was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania in 1942. He was the first of four children, in an Irish-American Catholic family. Young Joe's biggest challenge was overcoming a speech impediment - a stutter - that afflicted him well into high school. His technique of practising speaking in front of a mirror paid off after several months. Mr Biden attended the University of Delaware and then law school at Syracuse University. He later married his first wife, Neilia, and started his political career in Wilmington. Mr Trump says he got into the property business with a ""small"" $1m loan from his father, before joining Fred Trump's company. There, he helped manage an extensive portfolio of residential housing estates in New York City, eventually taking control of the company. In 1971, he renamed it the Trump Organization. Six years later, Donald Trump married his first wife, Ivana Zelnickova, a Czech athlete and model. His children from his first marriage - Donald Jr, Ivanka and Eric - now help run Trump Organization, though he is still chief executive. Joe Biden was eagerly waiting to take up his seat in the US Senate, having been elected in 1972, when tragedy struck. His wife and infant daughter Naomi were killed in a car accident. His sons Beau and Hunter were seriously injured. Mr Biden famously took the oath of office for his first term as a Democratic Party senator from the hospital room of his toddler sons. In the late 1970s Mr Trump stepped his ambitions up a gear, shifting his property focus from Brooklyn and Queens to glitzy Manhattan. After snapping up a rundown hotel and transforming it into the Grand Hyatt he built the most famous Trump property - the 68-storey Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue. It opened in 1983. Other properties bearing the famous name followed - Trump Place, Trump World Tower, Trump International Hotel and Tower - and his powerful brand began to draw media interest.  But not everything he touched turned to gold. Mr Trump's ventures have led to four business bankruptcy filings. During his first 14 years in Washington, Mr Biden rebuilt his personal life after the deaths of his wife and daughter. He committed to giving his sons a semblance of a normal life, and commuted each day from the family home in Delaware to Washington DC. He eventually remarried, to schoolteacher Jill Jacobs, with whom he had another child, Ashley. Mr Biden established himself on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and began to build a national profile. In 1987, he launched his first go at the US presidency, but withdrew after he was accused of plagiarising a speech by the then leader of the British Labour Party, Neil Kinnock. Property alone was not enough for Mr Trump, who moved into the entertainment sector, snapping up a clutch of beauty pageants in 1996: Miss Universe, Miss USA, and Miss Teen USA. In his personal life, after splitting with Ivana he married actress Marla Maples in 1993. They had a daughter, Tiffany, before divorcing in 1999 - the same year Mr Trump's father died. ""My father was my inspiration,"" Mr Trump said at the time. On 11 October 1991, the US public were glued to their TVs as Anita Hill, a law professor at the University of Oklahoma, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The committee was holding a hearing into the nomination for the US Supreme Court of Clarence Thomas. Ms Hill alleged he had sexually harassed her on many occasions when they had both worked for the Reagan administration. As chairman of the committee, Joe Biden led the hearing. His handling of Ms Hill's evidence has long been criticised. The hearing was conducted by an all-white, all-male panel, and several women apparently willing to back up Ms Hill's account were not called by Mr Biden to testify. Speaking in a TV interview in April 2019, Mr Biden said that he was ""sorry for the way she got treated"". In 2003, Mr Trump fronted a new reality TV show that played to his reputations as both a businessman and a media personality. Called The Apprentice. the programme featured contestants competing for a shot at a management job in Mr Trump's commercial empire. He hosted the show for 14 seasons, and claimed in a financial disclosure form that he had been paid a total of $213m by the network during the show's run. Meanwhile, in 2005, he married his current wife, Melania Knauss, a Yugoslavian-born model. The couple have one son, Barron William Trump. Mr Biden had another shot at the presidency in 2008 before dropping out. But while his campaign had failed to break through, he was to reappear later that year in a role that assured him international prominence. On 23 August 2008, Mr Obama introduced Joe Biden as his vice-presidential running mate. It was a winning ticket and the pair eventually served two terms, establishing a close working relationship in which Mr Biden frequently called Mr Obama his ""brother"". It was not until June 2015 that Mr Trump formally announced his entrance into the race for the White House. His campaign for the presidency was rocked by controversies, including the emergence of a recording from 2005 of him making lewd remarks about women, and claims, including from members of his own party, that he was not fit for office. But he consistently told his army of supporters that he would defy the opinion polls, which mostly had him trailing his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. He said his presidency would strike a blow against the political establishment and ""drain the swamp"" in Washington. He took inspiration from the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, saying he would pull off ""Brexit times 10"". Despite almost all the predictions, Mr Trump was victorious in the 2016 election. He was inaugurated as the 45th US president on 20 January 2017. In a surprise ceremony in the final days of his presidency, Mr Obama awarded Mr Biden the Presidential Medal of Freedom - the nation's highest civilian honour. ""To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretence, services without self-regard and to live life fully,"" the then president said. It had been a successful partnership, but a period not without trauma for Mr Biden, whose son Beau died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46. The younger Biden was seen as a rising star of US politics and had intended to run for Delaware state governor in 2016. Mr Trump's re-election campaign has been conducted against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic, in which 230,000 Americans have died, and seen the president himself become infected. First Lady Melania Trump and their son Barron caught the virus too, along with a number of staff at the White House. In the days before the election on 3 November, Trump urged states to shun lockdowns, whilst continuing his schedule of rallies in battleground states. The two presidential rivals' divisions over the coronavirus have been deep, with Mr Biden having said the president's handling of the worsening coronavirus crisis was an ""insult"" to its victims. ""Even if I win, it's going to take a lot of hard work to end this pandemic,"" he said. ""I do promise this - we will start on day one doing the right things.""

20,Baby Shark becomes YouTube's most-watched video of all time,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 15:30:22 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54783116,,"Baby Shark, the infuriatingly catchy children's rhyme recorded by South Korean company Pinkfong, has become the most-watched video ever on YouTube. The song has now been played 7.04 billion times, overtaking the previous record holder Despacito, the Latin pop smash by singer Luis Fonsi. Played back-to-back, that would mean Baby Shark has been streamed continuously for 30,187 years. Pinkfong stands to have made about $5.2m (£4m) from YouTube streams alone. It took four years for Baby Shark to ascend to the top of YouTube's most-played chart, but the song is actually much older than that. It is thought to have originated in US summer camps in the 1970s. One theory says it was invented in 1975, as Steven Spielberg's Jaws became an box office smash around the world. There are a huge number of variations on the basic premise, including one version where a surfer loses an arm to the shark, and another where the protagonist dies. There are also international versions - including the French Bebe Requin and the German Kleiner Hai (Little Shark), which became a minor hit in Europe in 2007. But none of them could match the phenomenal success of Pinkfong's interpretation, which was sung by 10-year-old Korean-American singer Hope Segoine and uploaded to YouTube in 2015. It's addictive ""doo doo doo doo doo doo"" hook and fishy dance moves became a craze in South Korea, where popular bands like Red Velvet, Girls' Generation and Blackpink started incorporating it into their concerts. The following June, Pinkfong put out a second video, titled Baby Shark Dance, featuring two cute kids performing the dance routine. That clip that inspired the hashtag #BabySharkChallenge - with everyone from Indonesian farmworkers to pop stars Cardi B and Josh Groban joining the fun. The song is catnip for children, whose appetite for repetition has undoubtedly helped it climb the ranks of YouTube's most-watched videos. ""Nursery rhymes have always been sort of slow, very cute, but something that would help your children fall asleep - as opposed to Baby Shark,"" Pinkfong's marketing director Jamie Oh told the BBC in 2018. ""Pinkfong's Baby Shark is very trendy and it has a very bright beat with fun dance moves. The animation is very vivid. We call it K-Pop for the next generation."" The company is turning the song into a movie and a musical, and aspires to make Baby Shark ""another classic for kids music, like Twinkle Twinkle Little Star"", Oh added. However, Pinkfong's parent company SmartStudy was sued last year by children's songwriter Jonathan Wright, who recorded a similar arrangement of the song in 2011 and argues that he owns the copyright to that interpretation. SmartStudy responded that their verison was ""based on a traditional sing-along chant which has passed to public domain"". The case is still under consideration by the Korea Copyright Commission. Last month, the song was at the centre of another controversy, when three prison workers in Oklahoma were accused of using it to punish inmates. According to court documents, five prisoners were handcuffed against a wall and forced to stand for two hours while listening to Baby Shark on repeat. Exposure to the song put ""undue emotional stress on the inmates who were most likely already suffering"", said district attorney David Prater. But the song has also been put to positive use.  When Eliane Jabbour unexpectedly found herself in the middle of an anti-government demonstration in Lebanon last October, she was concerned the commotion would scare her 15-month-old son, who had just woken from a nap in the passenger seat of her car. Instead, the protestors circled her car and sang Baby Shark to help calm the toddler down.  A video of the episode in Beirut - with Robin staring wide-eyed at the singing and dancing - itself went viral, and became a symbol of hope amid the protests.

21,'I thought maybe I would die': S Korea's delivery drivers demand change,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:01:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54775719,,"It was an hour before sunrise, 21 hours into a shift, and Mr Kim had delivered more than 400 packages. The 36-year-old delivery driver had been working since 5am the previous day. He messaged a colleague, pleading to skip a round of parcel deliveries.  ""It's too much,"" he wrote. ""I just can't.""  Four days later, Mr Kim was dead. He is one of 14 workers in South Korea who union officials say died because of overwork - most of them delivery drivers.  The fates of the 14 drivers can not be directly linked to overwork, but their families described the causes of death as ""kwarosa"" - a Korean term used for sudden death due to heart failure or a stroke as a result of extreme hard work. Drivers in South Korea are struggling to cope with the sheer volume of online orders during the Covid-19 pandemic. As the packages have piled up, so has the pressure.  Can you work yourself to death?South Korea gaming: Death by overwork sparks calls for changeIs Japan's culture of overwork finally changing? One of the drivers who died was 27-year-old Jang Deok-jin, a former Taekwondo enthusiast who had lost 15kg (33lbs) after doing 18 months of night shifts, according to his family. Deok-jin came home from a night shift earlier this month at around six in the morning and headed for a shower. His father found him dead face down in the bathtub an hour later.  ""We loved that boy. When he said it was such hard work we told him it was ok to stop working, but he used to tell me that he had plans for his future,"" his father said. ""I am to blame for not discouraging him from working so hard and exploiting himself."" Mr Jang's anger took him to South Korea's National Assembly. In grief he fell to his knees and begged congressmen to look at the circumstances surrounding his son's death.  ""It is my son who died,"" he said. ""I am going to let the whole world know about it. I am going to get to the bottom of it."" Deok-jin's case, along with others, won the attention of President Moon Jae-in, who called for an overhaul of working conditions for delivery employees, saying they had suffered some of the worst hardships under the pandemic.  The pressure is particularly acute in South Korea, where home deliveries are expected in hours not days.  In August, South Korea's labour ministry stepped in and urged the country's major logistics companies to sign a declaration to ensure drivers got enough rest and did not have to work continuous overnight shifts. Three of the biggest firms, CJ Logistics, Coupang and Hanjin Transportation, all made public apologies over the deaths of workers.  CJ Logistics said it would add more drivers and ensure all couriers were signed up for industrial accident insurance. Coupang said it was hiring more people while admitting the step was ""not enough"". Hanjin Transportation pledged to reduce the workload for its staff.  But most contracts signed by the workers are with independent agents who act as middlemen, rather than with the company itself, leaving them outside the protection of labour law. Union leaders also said they had yet to see the promised increase in manpower at most depots. Around the developed world, delivery drivers are bearing the burden and the cost of the pandemic-induced new normal. The coronavirus has accelerated our love of internet shopping - each year, demand for delivered goods has increased by 10% in South Korea. This year, so far, it has increased by double that. No human interaction is needed when shopping online, but there are humans involved in the transaction.  I visited a warehouse depot the size of an aircraft hanger on the outskirts of Seoul last week, where several hundred workers for Lotte Global Logistics were on strike demanding better pay and conditions. Their rally cry was, ""We want to live"". Kim Duk-yeon, 48, hadn't told his family he was on the picket line, as they knew he could not afford to go a day without pay. ""Before I used to think this work was just hard, but this year especially with the increased shipping due to the coronavirus, the situation on the ground got a lot worse,"" he said. ""As I worked more and more I thought maybe I too would die."" As the union march made its way through the warehouse there was an incessant clatter from the conveyor belts which snaked around the building moving thousands of boxes and bags of all shapes and sizes. Hundreds of delivery vans were lined up in neat rows with very little space between them. The drivers have to sort their own packages before they can even get behind the wheel.  Duk-yeon gets to the depot around 6.30am and can be sorting and packing for four to five hours before he gets on the road. Filling the trucks is like a giant jigsaw puzzle - fitting smaller and larger boxes into the space. No package can be left behind. Drivers there said they are paid around 800 Korean won per parcel ($0.70, £0.50), and these days they deliver around 350 packages a day. Most also have to pay for the wages of workers who bring packages down to the floor of the warehouse, and they have to pay penalties if deliveries are late or lost. The day after I visited the depot, Lotte Global Logistics settled its dispute with the unions. The company also pledged to deploy a thousand more workers to sorting stations and abolish the penalty payments.  Shin Bok-sun, a 43-year-old mother of three, said she hoped one day the workload would be reduced enough that she could see her kids at night. ""We are under a lot of pressure. There are customers who order groceries and call incessantly to complain that they need to make lunch or dinner with their order,"" she said. ""If the delivery doesn't come the same day, customers will call and say, 'I need to wear this skirt to go out today. Why is it coming at midday?'""  There are some small signs the deaths of delivery worker deaths is having an impact on South Korean shoppers. In the windows of some apartments you can see notes which read, ""Dear deliveryman, it's okay to be late"". In my apartment block, people have started to meet our delivery man with hot coffee and some breakfast. And hashtags like #it_is_ok_to_be_late, #Thankyoudeliverymen and #weneedtostopthedeathofdeliverymen have trended on social media. The coronavirus pandemic is likely to be with us for some time, and may have altered our shopping habits in the long term. These small signs of appreciation for the delivery drivers may not substantially change the demands placed on them but the gestures are welcomed by drivers as they prepare for the long shift ahead. "

Actor, and curator of the series Mat Fraser, explains.  Growing up as a young disabled boy in a mainstream, non-disabled school, the whole world seemed able-bodied to me. I didn't know any disabled people, let alone kids my age. At that time, television seemed to reinforce the notion that we pretty much didn't exist, or, when we did, it was generally pitiful. The only disabled character I saw on TV in the 1970s was Sandy in the soap Crossroads. He was paraplegic, and used a wheelchair.  Even now, jobs in TV drama have continued to be few and far between, so it means there are thousands of untold stories, experiences and performances. So, I welcomed the opportunity to curate CripTales - six, 15-minute monologues - about the disabled experience over the last 50 years, exploring disabled women's, people of colour and LGBT+ voices, not to mention faces. But why call it CripTales?  Crip is a reclaimed word of self-empowerment and disability pride. It's free of pity, charity or tragedy, and was taken up by the disability rights movement in the 1980s.  It was the title that I and the other participants wanted. The entire series has been written, directed and acted by disabled people, as part of the BBC's Queers and Snatches series.   Jack Thorne is probably the most famous disabled screenwriter. He started his career on Shameless and Skins, and adapted Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials last year. For CripTales, he wrote Hamish. Set in 1981, Hamish's parents have bought him a new wheelchair. Crucially, it is a self-operated vehicle and a chance for independence, as he's always been pushed everywhere by carers before. Hamish heads for the woods, in search of carnal pleasure…  For my own monologue - Audition - which I wrote and performed, I wanted to expose and poke fun at the audition process and the many weird, wonderful and often awful auditions I've had over the last 20 years. One such example is an audition I did in the late 90s for a popular TV drama, when many in the industry weren't very good at hiding their prejudice.  The audition went well. The casting guy said I had a very suitable voice and persona. Two weeks later I hadn't heard anything, so my agent called him.  ""Oh, there's a problem,"" he said. ""The character needs to drive."" My agent pointed out that I had a full driving licence.   ""Sorry, it's not going to work out with Mat this time,"" he said.  I drew on my bewilderment and embarrassment for the monologue, which speaks directly to the industry.  I have had success in other auditions, as you may know if you've watched American Horror Story: Freak Show or His Dark Materials.  Deaf director Jenny Sealey handles Matilda Ibini's story about the power dynamic of carers and their disabled ""clients"", from a gay black disabled woman's perspective in The Shed, performed by Carly Houston.  It's about a writer who falls in love with Keira, her next-door neighbour. But Ellie, her carer, does not approve of the relationship, and starts to subtly block and subvert the romance, with dangerous consequences.  It's a chilling tale exploring the power that can be exerted over a wheelchair-user's life.  This is a perfect example of the stories that TV audiences have previously not had access to, which can only enrich our understanding of humanity in society. Much like deaf writer Genevieve Barr's unflinching story, Thunderbox. Set against the new law allowing abortion in the UK in 1968, it asks who is in charge of a disabled woman's body and who gets to decide about childbirth, when religion, family and society's beliefs often influence those decisions.  While it was a moment of liberation for some, for wheelchair-user Sue, brilliantly acted by Bafta-nominated actor Ruth Madeley, it throws up questions about bodies and belief. A whirlwind romance has left her  pregnant - what should she do now? And then there is The Real Deal, performed by Liz Carr (Clarissa from Silent Witness) about the UK benefits system and how some disabled people don't get what's theirs while others, who may be fakers, get the full bundle.  It's really cheeky, yet a vital comment on the currently often dire situation so many British disabled people are in, as services are cut.  I'm sure the BBC and other broadcasters will see the talent, recognise the lived experiences, and start commissioning and casting more work from our fine CripTales bunch, or it runs the risk of being a tokenistic project. CripTales is just the tip of the disability iceberg, but the lumbering Titanic of incorrect portrayals and impairment-obsessed caricatures has sunk into history, finally. The future is authentic, diverse and includes disabled people in all their myriad guises.  CripTales can be watched at 10pm on BBC Four on 4 and 5 November and watched  on BBC iPlayer afterwards.

23,#EndSars protests: How Anthony Unuode gave his life for a better Nigeria,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:09:19 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-54747916,,"More than 6ft (183cm) tall and well-built, Anthony Unuode, 28, dreamed of serving in the Nigerian army, but was killed by thugs breaking up protests against police brutality in the capital Abuja, writes the BBC's Nduka Orjinmo after attending his memorial.  As hundreds of candles burned into the night, friends, family and strangers spoke about Anthony and his selflessness, while some shuffled their feet in grief, heavy with the burden of his death. ""Have we betrayed the dead?"" asked one man, who said he did not know Anthony personally but, like many others, felt a kinship had developed between them during the protests against police brutality that rocked Nigeria last month.  The protests were held under the #EndSars banner, a reference to demands for the disbandment of the notorious Special Anti-Robbery Squad, whose officers were repeatedly accused of criminal activity ranging from extortion to extra-judicial killings.  ""He died fighting for the same thing we are fighting for,"" said another speaker, who followed Anthony on Twitter. Protesters said that Anthony was brave. When thugs suspected to be hired by politicians to crush protests attacked them on 11 October at the Berger roundabout in Abuja, he stepped forward and shielded those he could, escaping with a minor injury on his arm. Three days later, the thugs launched another attack with machetes, daggers and wooden sticks to disrupt a march along Abuja's Kubwa expressway. It is unclear whether Anthony was among the marchers or just happened to be walking in the area, but, his friends say, he suffered deep machete wounds to his head.  With blood gushing from his head, he removed his shirt, wrapped it over his wounds and ran for miles seeking help, finally collapsing in front of his friend Muazu Suleiman. ""I put him in the car and drove as fast as I could to the national hospital, but when we got there, there were no hand gloves, no cotton wools, no drugs. I had to go and buy these things from outside,"" said Muazu. ""When they wanted to do surgery they were using their phone lights, some of the tools they needed were locked behind glass,"" he added. Hospital spokesman Tayo Hastrup denied the allegation, describing it as a ""lie"".  But Anthony's elder brother, Austin Unuode, also complained about the hospital, saying medics ""couldn't run some of the tests because there was no electricity"". ""These were the things he fought against, he believed that things needed to change in Nigeria,"" he added. Eze Divine, who attended the candlelight memorial held at Anthony's home, called for justice.  ""It's bad that those that killed him may never get arrested because these are state-sponsored thugs.  ""If we are asking for an end to police brutality and they are sending thugs, it says a lot about the government. It could have been me, it could have been anybody,"" he said. The police told the BBC that they were investigating Anthony's murder, and no arrests had yet been made. You may also be interested in: Why Nigerian looters are targeting Covid-19 aidThe protests which have changed Nigeria foreverNigerian horror over #EndSars protest shootingsHow Nigeria's anti-police brutality protests went global A graduate in education at the Nasarawa state university close to Abuja, Anthony was a reflection of young Nigerians in many ways. In a country where millions of graduates are unemployed and get little support from the state, most young people create their ways of earning a living.  At the time of his death Anthony was running three online betting shops. He was also a small-time estate agent and ""did anything that would bring legitimate money"", said his brother Austin. ""It's a big loss, because since my father died, he has been the breadwinner of the family. ""My mother is not even around to see his last remains lowered as she travelled abroad,"" he added. It was not only armed thugs who had been deployed to crush the protests, but also soldiers who - two days after Anthony's death - shot protesters at the Lekki toll gate in the commercial hub of Lagos.  Although the military has denied that troops opened fire, Amnesty International and multiple eyewitnesses are adamant that they killed at least 10 protesters there.   Ironically, Anthony, before his death, had applied to join the army, believing it was his patriotic duty to help in the fight against militant Islamist group Boko Haram, which has been waging a brutal insurgency in the north of the country for more than a decade.  ""He always talked about joining the army to fight Boko Haram. ""He was passionate about Nigeria and Africa and always wanted to give his quota,"" said Anthony's brother. Unlike many protesters, Anthony had never been a victim of police brutality himself but he joined the demonstrations because he wanted a better Nigeria.  ""When he saw the youths coming together, he called me and said this was a turning point,"" said his close friend Shedrack. The day after Anthony was buried, the leaders of the protest movement and thousands of others held an online session for more than four hours to map a way forward following the end of the mass protests that saw Nigeria's massive young population demonstrate its power. ""What next? Where do we go from here?"" asked moderator Ebuka Obi-Uchendu as he opened the Zoom session after a minute's silence in honour of the dead. In his response musician and lawyer Folarin Falana, better known as Falz, said: ""I dare say things will never be the same in Nigeria again. ""The work now lies in citizen education, letting people know about their rights and the laws."" Other speakers urged the youth to get involved in politics, and use their numbers to elect capable representatives. ""What we have seen is that we can gather and we can organise,"" said Feyikemi Abudu of the Feminist Coalition, one of the main protest groups. She is referred to as ""the president"" by her thousands of followers online for her exceptional organisational skills that made the demonstrations a success. ""Things that we didn't think could be done in months or years were achieved in weeks and it is that energy that we need to keep,"" she said. Anthony's friends agree, pointing out that he had written on his private Instagram account almost prophetic words before his death. ""To my generation of Nigerians. I love you and you have earned my maximum and genuine respect.  ""The powers that be are truly against us and are doing everything in their power to stop this movement. It will get worse, but please let us never back down,"" Anthony had written. "
24,Be a 'secret agent' and other new ways to exercise,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:04:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54429713,,"It might have been one of my regular runs around the streets of Singapore, but the experience was spiced with danger. I was the hero in my very own spy story, speeding from one checkpoint to another to foil the bad guys. The plot came from a running app called Running Stories, which casts you as a secret agent in a story playing out with a heart-thumping soundtrack. It is one of the latest apps designed to make exercise more entertaining, using real-time data that integrates the plot with your surroundings. Key events in the storyline are triggered when a runner passes specific GPS markers and landmarks.  From being shot at by snipers to racing to catch a speedboat along the river, the plot kept me engaged and burned plenty of calories. Despite the scorching sun, I managed to complete the mission, save the day and fight the flab. These new breed of apps are designed to motivate those who don't normally enjoy running while encouraging new runners to take up the sport. For seasoned runners they offer the chance to add in short sprints to get the heart rate up during your exercise. ""It gets you to explore new routes by using real-time data that turns your run into a story. It's like Hollywood, Silicon Valley and your personal coach had a baby,"" says Joachim Borgstrom, creative lead for the app. Running Stories is being piloted in Singapore with plans to roll it out in cities around the world. ""We want to make the app available as an open source platform so that writers and creators can devise their own stories.  ""There are also plans to incorporate more real-time data like weather conditions and the runner's heart rate to enrich the experience,"" Mr Borgstrom adds. And if horror movies are more your thing, imagine being chased by zombies. Originally released in 2012, the Zombies, Run! app, developed by British studio Six to Start, has been downloaded almost 10 million times and half a million people run with it every month, according to the company, More Technology of Business Why the humble text message is a key campaign toolThe explosive problem of 'zombie' batteriesThe apps promising to improve your sex lifeThe forklift truck drivers that never leave their desksNew jets promise to revive supersonic travel Its biggest market is the US, followed by the UK, Canada and Australia.  ""The idea came from two places - I'd always wanted to make running more fun, and I was convinced that an audio-only game would be a perfect fit for an activity where you can't look at your phone,"" says founder Adrian Hon.  Six to Start is now moving beyond zombies and adding science-fiction, historical and romance stories, Mr Hon told the BBC. During the pandemic and the associated lockdowns, some fitness companies saw sales skyrocket, including exercise-bike firm Peloton. But will such trends last? ""We believe the shift to at-home fitness has been under way for some time, just as you've seen films shift from the cinema into the home and video games from arcades to the home, where you can get a higher quality experience on your own time,"" Kevin Cornils, international managing director at Peloton, told the BBC. Peloton has seen huge sales of its premium-priced bikes during the pandemic and can count Usain Bolt, David Beckham and Michelle Obama among its celebrity fans. ""People will continue to realise that they can get that same motivation that they used to get in a gym from the comfort of their own home so I do see the current trends continuing,"" Mr Cornils adds. One of Peloton's big attractions is its connectivity. The bike's onboard technology can connect with other riders so you can race against others in your own virtual Tour de France, or take part in real-time classes with an instructor online. Other companies offer similar products. ""We are finding a strong surge in connectivity among the younger generations and this will not be isolated from fitness,"" says Lou Lentine, chief executive of Echelon Fitness, a rival to Peloton. But is he worried people will go back to gyms once the pandemic is over? ""I think people will continue to go to the traditional gym, but due to convenience and other factors there may be a hybrid experience where people are continuing to incorporate connected fitness,"" Mr Lentine says. Wearable technology like fitness trackers have seen strong growth in the last few years. From $3.2bn (£2.4bn) in 2018 the industry is expected to grow to $5.1bn this year and $6.2bn in 2021. As they evolve, wearable devices are moving beyond the traditional realm of fitness. ""The evolution of wearable devices mirrors the changing way that people think about fitness. Many are no longer satisfied with tracking basic indicators such as their weight, height, and how many steps they take in a day,"" said a spokesman for Fitbit. Instead, the brand has seen a desire from users to move away from ""body fit"" to pursue other aspects of fitness such as mental wellness, sleep quality and heart health.   ""The future of fitness and wearables is about making the invisible visible - unlocking even more information about our bodies to take better control of our health and wellness,"" the Fitbit spokesman added.  Metrics being introduced include heart-rate variability, skin temperature and SpO2 sensors, which measure oxygen levels in your blood. Along with helping people to stay fit, such innovations have the potential to serve as an early warning system that something has changed in your wellbeing.  With no vaccine yet developed for Covid-19 and global spikes in infection rates, the demand for such health technology is stronger than ever. So what's next for exercise technology? Experts say the driving forces are technological advances such as artificial intelligence (AI) and a change in behaviour in a post-Covid world. One day in the near future all aspects of fitness, from devices, to food, to training videos, will be brought together in one service, says Sid Pathak, an expert in consumer industries for Kearney, a management consulting firm. ""While individual solutions exist for everything - an intelligent weighing scale, a heart-rate monitor, a tracker - they don't talk to each other and provide the consumer a one-stop solution,"" he says.

25,Inside the Johnny Depp court case,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 17:05:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-54506759,,"In May 2016, Amber Heard, a 30-year-old actress, arrived at a Los Angeles court seeking a restraining order against her husband, the Hollywood star Johnny Depp. As she left the building, she found herself surrounded by photographers, journalists and film crews. On her cheek was what appeared to be a mark. The court was also shown photographs of what looked like facial bruising. She said Depp had ""violently"" attacked her and in a rage had thrown a mobile phone at her face with ""extreme force"". There were also allegations of other incidents of domestic violence. She said she had endured ""excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse"" and ""angry, hostile, humiliating and threatening assaults"". Depp denied the abuse. The restraining order was granted, and soon after the marriage was over. Four years later the couple were back in court, but this time in London. However, this was not Amber Heard's case - she had not chosen to be here. This was a libel action Depp had brought against a British newspaper, The Sun. At the heart of the case was his assertion that the allegations of physical abuse were an ""elaborate hoax"". Depp employed one of the best-known libel barristers in the country to try to prove the claims were untrue. Over the next three weeks, Heard arrived at court each day and walked past her former husband's fans, who were convinced that it was their hero who was the victim and it was she who had assaulted him. In court her story, photos, memories and the accounts of her friends were all exposed to the world and said by Depp's team and supporters to be part of a plot to falsely prove that he was, as The Sun had claimed in April 2018, a ""wife beater"". It was not just the fans and media who were watching carefully. Lawyers were already wondering, if he won, what impact this would have on women coming forward with claims of domestic violence. Outside, Johnny Depp would arrive each day to cheers. But his behaviour and lifestyle were also under the microscope - and a judge has now ruled that The Sun's allegations were ""substantially true"". Depp loses 'wife-beater' libel case again The Sun ""Would you like a Johnny Depp face mask?"" A woman holding a cardboard box offered me a small brown envelope. Inside was a black-and-white bandana and personal note of thanks from Johnny Depp. The woman, who was part of the actor's entourage, disappeared into court as all around me fans and onlookers began to inspect their new scarves. This was a strange court case. The rest of Britain was in lockdown, buses and streets in central London were deserted, and yet here, outside the Royal Courts of Justice, there was a crowd, sometimes more than 200 strong. Some wore masks but when Johnny Depp arrived, all attempts at social distancing collapsed in the crush to catch a glimpse.  Inside the High Court, it was even more peculiar. The Royal Courts of Justice are huge, gothic and deeply solemn. It's a place of stone arches and hushed tones. And in July it was almost empty. I say almost, because there were a few people - a handful of journalists hurrying through security, and also lingering in the hallways and passages a scattering of Depp fans.   One woman showed me her arms, which were covered in tattoos of Johnny Depp. Another man arrived each day dressed as Jack Sparrow, the star's character in Pirates of the Caribbean.   And then at around 10:00 each day they would gather at the door to Court 13. As Depp walked past they would offer messages of support and, towards the end of the case, he was seen giving them all a hug. A little chant of ""Johnny, Johnny"" could be heard as he walked into court. Ten minutes later, he was sitting in the witness stand trying to convince a High Court judge he was not a ""wife beater"". The accusations were shocking. Heard said she had been assaulted by him on more than 14 occasions. She said she had, at times, been in fear for her life and left with a broken nose, black eyes and split lip. Vicious, drunken tirades had, she said, lasted for days. There was also a 15th allegation too traumatic and personal to be heard in open court.   It felt like a criminal trial; Depp was being accused of repeated assaults on his former partner, the sort of violence that has sent others to prison. But this wasn't a criminal trial. It was easy to forget this was a libel battle between Depp and News Group Newspapers, the publishers of The Sun, because no-one from the newspaper was called to the witness stand. Dan Wootton, the journalist whose article had said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" that the actor was a ""wife beater"" was not even on the list of 79 names cited in the trial's documents. And what a list of names it was. The case began with an email exchange about the perils of addiction between Depp and Sir Elton John and then continued with references to a bewildering cast of characters. James Franco, Marilyn Manson, Elon Musk, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss and Vanessa Paradis were all guest stars in a story that took a private world of the Hollywood A-list and blew it apart.   We were shown text messages and video footage of meetings in lifts. The super-rich spend millions protecting their privacy and here was a couple revealing a telephone directory's worth of secrets. No star would do this unless they felt there was something bigger at stake. For Depp, that was restoring his reputation. But why did this battle begin in the UK? The article with the Dan Wootton byline, in particular the phrase ""wife beater"" in a headline that was later changed, had given Johnny Depp a chance to test his ex-wife's claims in court - and what's more, an English court.     What is libel and how does it work? It would require a much longer article to explain all the differences, but the essence of the legal split between England and America is that if you write something defamatory in London, the burden is on you to prove it is true.   In America, the defamed person has to prove it isn't true, a very different task. It sounds a slender legal nicety but it can make all the difference.   England and Wales's libel law was tightened in 2013, but it is still one of the best places in the world for the rich (and it is a rich person's game) to take on the media. If you want to win a libel case and you have a choice about where to bring it, lawyers will suggest buying a ticket to Heathrow.   And if you want to understand how big an issue this was for Depp's reputation, look at what he was trading. He lived in a world of security guards and private planes. Going to court blew it apart. If you ever wondered what it was like to be Depp, this case lifted the lid on his privileged but erratic existence, his temper and his history with drink and drugs.  Amber Heard was 22 when she met Johnny Depp on the set of the film The Rum Diary in 2009. He was 23 years older and in a long-term relationship with singer and actress Vanessa Paradis. Heard's wife at the time was the artist Tasya Van Ree. Two years later, Heard was living with Depp in a penthouse in downtown LA, Depp having separated from Paradis, his partner of 14 years. Heard and Depp married in February 2015, and just over a year later it was over.    Since then, Amber Heard has become a vocal campaigner on the issue of domestic and sexual abuse. The UN Human Rights Campaign named her as a Human Rights Champion for her work promoting women's rights. She became an Ambassador for Women's Rights for the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and she has given speeches and written in the Washington Post and New York Times about her experience of domestic violence.    In the era of Me Too, she was a leading figure, speaking up for women who had suffered in silence by revealing the abuse she had endured at the hands of one of the most powerful people in Hollywood. She was Amber Heard, actor, model, activist and domestic abuse survivor. When Johnny Depp described her accusations as a hoax, he was not just challenging her story, he was ripping away the foundations of her public profile. There was a lot at stake here.  The entire process, which involved an almost brutal public examination of a couple's private life, has been a warning to anyone who wants to use the courts to restore a reputation.   It was clearly a deeply troubled relationship, but the case depended on proving who had done what to whom. And in the end, the judge decided it was true to describe Depp as a ""wife beater"".

26,Undercover Policing Inquiry: 'We want answers',"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 12:19:02 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-54780630,,"A long-delayed inquiry into abuses in undercover policing operations dating stretching over four decades is underway in London.  More than 200 members of the public are seeking answers as to what went on within controversial units targeting campaign groups.  Four people affected by the actions of the officers explain why they want to get at the truth. Interviewed by June Kelly and Dominic Casciani.  In 1997, Sukhdev Reel's 20-year-old son Ricky Reel was on a night out in Kingston-upon-Thames, south west London.  He and his friends were attacked and racially abused by two white men.  In the aftermath, Ricky disappeared and a week later his body was found in the River Thames.  The police said his death was probably an accident - but his family have always believed Ricky was murdered.  It's already emerged that the Metropolitan Police had an officer working undercover to gather information on the family campaign for justice for Stephen Lawrence, who was murdered in 1992.  Mrs Reel says she has been told that an officer who spied on the Lawrence campaign was also gathering intelligence on her fight for answers.  As the inquiry starts, the family and their supporters are launching a petition calling on the police to re-examine all the forensic evidence in Ricky's case using new technology.  Faith Mason's son, Neil Martin, was severely disabled, unable to walk and talk.  He died a month after his sixth birthday in 1969. Fifty years later it emerged that from the late 1980s, an undercover officer used Neil's first and middle names and his date of birth to create a fake identity.  Faith believes the officer may have travelled to County Durham, where the family live, and visited the cemetery where Neil is buried to look at the headstone on his grave. She is now unable to go there and wants to replace the headstone.  Kate Wilson was in her twenties and involved in campaigns for social justice when in 2003 she met a fellow activist, calling himself Mark Stone. They had an eighteen-month relationship and remained friends until 2010 - when he was unmasked as an undercover officer sent to infiltrate the environmental movement.  His real name was Mark Kennedy and he was married with children.  The truth was discovered by another activist who had been in a a six year relationship with Kennedy.  Kate has learned that a number of other people she regarded as friends have also turned out to be undercover police officers.  Shane Collins is a Green Party councillor in Froome, Somerset. For decades he's been involved in campaigns to protect the environment.  The network he was part of was infiltrated by Mark Kennedy and another undercover officer, Jim Boyling. In 2009, Cllr Collins and 113 others were arrested in Nottingham and held on suspicion of a plot to disrupt one of the country's most important coal-fired power stations.  Mark Kennedy later confessed to campaigners his role in setting up the action. Shane Collins wants to know how deep the infiltration went.  "
27,Gyms and coronavirus: What are the facts?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 14:07:17 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-54540188,,"For the second time this year, gyms in England are closing their doors.  Some areas such as Liverpool had already turned off their treadmills, but now the rest of the country is following suit. It's after the government announced a second national lockdown, which means pubs, restaurants, non-essential shops and places of worship will also be closing on 5 November.  But what's the science behind shutting gyms?  Are they riskier than shopping or going to a restaurant? And what will it mean for the mental health of gym users? ""It's very difficult to know for sure where people get their virus,"" according to Professor Jonathan Ball, who's a virologist at the University of Nottingham.  He says gyms are closing because the government is trying to react to the high number of coronavirus cases.  ""When you've got such huge numbers of cases in the community, particularly in people who are young and healthy, they may not experience any symptoms at all.  ""There's always a risk that you might interact with someone who's infected [without either of you knowing] and that allows the virus to transmit."" Gyms might not be as high risk as hospitals or care homes but Prof Ball tells Newsbeat: ""You do tend to exercise quite vigorously, that means that you can breathe rapidly and quite deeply.  ""Therefore, we'd expect that you could potentially produce droplets or aerosols that could go on to infect other people."" He also points out there are lots of areas of gyms that people touch, like handles and equipment, before touching their faces. There is a big ""but"" though. Prof Ball says a lot of that risk can be dramatically lowered through things like effective air-conditioning, regular cleaning, social distancing and hand sanitising. ""From the data that I've seen from Public Health England, I'm not aware that there is a significant hotspot for infections in the gym environment. ""We know where the major risks are but after that we know there are other activities where people mix and where people mix, there is a chance of transmission occurring."" The only government data on gyms comes from Public Health England's surveillance report, which is based on data from Test and Trace. That data puts gyms on 2.8%, while supermarkets are 11.2%, pubs and bars are 7.4% and secondary schools are 6.8%.  What those percentages mean is a bit tricky - here's where they come from. In the week to 25 October, 107,046 people who had tested positive for coronavirus were referred for contact tracing. Of those, 33,233 had been somewhere in the previous seven days that at least one other person contacted had visited. About 930 of those said they had been to the gym - that's 2.8% of all the common locations reported. We don't know if they caught it at the gym - we just know they visited the gym. Is that a lot? It's hard to tell - you need to take into account how many people visit a gym regularly compared with, for example, a supermarket. The point is that for the latest week, gyms came sixth on the list of common locations, ahead of people attending universities, people working in care homes and people going shopping for clothes. And the government is bound to have noticed that. Its scientific advisory group Sage estimated in September that closing indoor gyms and leisure centres could potentially reduce the R number (that's the average number of people each infected person infects) by 0.1, but stressed that estimating that was ""very difficult"". Trainer Nathan Penman spoke to Newsbeat just before his gym closed in Liverpool in mid-October. Gyms in the Liverpool City Region closed earlier than the rets of the country, when the region went into tier three - the highest Covid alert level. ""It's just a bizarre feeling in the gym. It's the same kind of consensus among everybody there."" As well as working in a gym, Nathan says exercising is hugely important for his physical and mental health. ""Health and fitness, physically and mentally should be a priority for the nation at the minute. ""So for the government to turn around and say that gyms are not important - I think it's giving off a ridiculous message."" Nathan says people in the gyms he trains in have followed the rules. But 29-year-old Jack Occleshaw, from Nottingham, isn't as confident. ""You could tell that staff at the gym had put in all the measures to make you feel comfortable and were taking the situation seriously,"" he says.  ""But it was more the actual members that were not keeping up."" Jack was frustrated by members not wiping down equipment after use and thinks staff should have enforced the rules more strictly. ""I also tend to swim to help with mental health and clear my head. ""In our gym you have to book a slot. But you'd see people walk past the pool and say 'I reckon I could fit in there'."" Jack's concerns about people not following advice meant he was put off from using the gym. But this is no longer a choice he, or other gym users, will have.  As you'd expect, gyms aren't happy about being forced to close, with Anytime Fitness among those calling on the government to review its decision.  The chain says the announcement is ""difficult to take"" given people have been using gyms for the last four months.  It adds that if the government goes ahead with plans to shut gyms and leisure centres, then ""comprehensive financial support will be needed.""

28,Geneva: Why the world's highest minimum wage was needed,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:03:18 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-54745033,,"Geneva is a very wealthy place. Home to a huge private banking sector, the United Nations, and auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's, which regularly sell enormous gemstones for eye-watering prices. And this month it is introducing the highest minimum monthly salary in the world, in response to a referendum at the end of September. The new hourly rate of 23 Swiss francs  - equivalent to £19, $25 or €22 - will give a minimum monthly salary of 4,000 francs (£3,350). This Swiss canton may be rich but it is also home to tens of thousands of hotel workers, waiters, cleaners and hairdressers who struggle to make ends meet. When Switzerland went into lockdown last March, images of lines of people at food banks in Geneva made headlines.  In fact, the food banks existed before the pandemic, and they are still there months after the lockdown ended. Charly Hernandez's charity Colis du Coeur distributes thousands of bags of groceries a week at one food bank in the city centre. The lines are long, most of the people queuing are women, many of them have young children. It may sound a lot, but only if you don't live in Geneva, Charly explains. ""A single room is 1,000 francs a month, if you can survive on 500 francs a month for food you're a very good manager, health insurance is 550 a month per person. If you are a family with two kids, you barely scrape by."" The new minimum wage will make a difference to many people, like Ingrid, who have been going to the food bank.  ""At the end of the month my pockets are empty,"" she says. ""This [food bank] has been great, because you have a week of food. A week of relief."" Even some of the volunteers, like Laura, find Geneva's cost of living difficult. On her nurse's salary, she can't really afford a place of her own in the city. ""I would be living in a very small place, in one room. So I still live with my family. I'm 26,"" she says. Businesses offering less than 23 francs an hour will now have to give employees a pay rise. To have to bear this new cost in the middle of the Covid pandemic and a drastic drop in profits could cause more harm than good, fears Vincent Subilia of Geneva's Chamber of Commerce.  ""Hotels, restaurants, these are areas which are already confronted with major challenges due to the pandemic,"" he says. ""This could potentially jeopardise the very existence of these sectors."" One restaurateur, Stefano Fanari, told Swiss television he did not think he would be able to foot the bill. As the head chef, his monthly wage averages between 5,000 and 6,000 francs a month. ""How can I continue when I have to pay the dish washers that much? ""Should I cut their hours? Don't get me wrong, I'm not against someone earning 4,000 a month. But there's a point where we just can't pay that. I've sacrificed, I work 12 hours a day here. What should I do?"" How high could the lowest wages go?Spain's minimum wage to jump 22% Geneva's minimum wage came into law not because the government imposed it, but because Geneva citizens proposed it as a ""people's initiative"". They gathered enough signatures to call a referendum on the issue, and on 27 September voters said yes, by a pretty overwhelming 58% to 42%. Switzerland's system of direct democracy means the voters have the final say, so the minimum wage is now obligatory.  Often, Swiss citizens tend to vote very cautiously when it comes to spending public money. But on the same day they also backed the nationwide introduction of two weeks' paid paternity leave.  For Charly Hernandez these moves are positive signs that, especially in such difficult times, people in this largely wealthy country are looking out for one another. ""They voted for it, and I'm elated. We do have a very direct democracy that is great, but what many people don't know is that most people's initiatives get turned down.  ""It's exceptional that things get approved, so I believe things are improving… OK at a slow pace, but that is the Swiss pace."" The next test for voters will come later this month when the Swiss will decide on a ""responsible business initiative"".  That would require companies based in Switzerland to take legal and financial responsibility for human rights and environmental abuses right along their supply chains, anywhere in the world.  A yes to that could cost far more than Geneva's world-beating minimum wage.

30,Can Brexit bring back the glory days of British fishing?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 01:25:12 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/stories-54756574,,"Today fishing contributes just a 10th of 1% to Britain's economy - less than Harrods, London's best-known department store - and yet it's at the centre of negotiations over the UK's post-Brexit deal with the EU. Lucy Ash went to Grimsby to find out whether its fishermen think Brexit can bring about a renaissance of their industry. Kurt Christensen, a dapper dresser in his 60s, is one of the best-known men in town. Several people stop him in the street for a chat. When we dive inside a hotel for a coffee, and to shelter from the biting wind, the barman rushes over to greet him. You might think, from his flat Lincolnshire vowels, that he's a Grimbarian born and bred. Yet as his name suggests, Kurt was born in Denmark. He came to England as the three-year-old son of a trawler skipper in search of richer fishing grounds.  Kurt's mother didn't want him to follow in his father's footsteps because the work was so dangerous. But, aged 15, he got a job on the dock during his summer holidays and says he took to the sea ""like a duck to water"". On his first voyage the weather was atrocious and waves towered over the boat, but the crew netted a good catch when few other boats were out, and Kurt got a handsome share of the profits.  ""I'd never seen that much money in one place,"" he laughs. ""So I pulled off five £1 notes, gave it to my mother and I said 'Here you are Mum, get yourself a nice dress!' ""It was halcyon times. I mean, it was brilliant. When fishing's good, it is astonishing. We could live like rock stars.""  Grimsby's population soared from 1,000 to 63,000 in the 19th Century, after the port was connected to the rest of the country by rail, and it went on rising. By the middle of the 20th Century, the former backwater on the Humber estuary was the biggest fishing port in the world. Fishermen who came ashore flush with cash were known as ""three-day millionaires"". They would keep taxis on the meter outside pubs all day while they drank and caroused until their next voyage, a few days later.   These hedonistic spending sprees were partly driven by superstition. Many fishermen believed that if they went back to sea with money left in their pockets, their boat would sink or they would return with empty nets.  They shared fishing grounds with the crews of other northern European countries as they had done for centuries. Back then, it seemed as though the fish would never run out and everyone could catch what they liked.  When the UK joined the European Economic Community in 1973, Kurt - by then a successful boat owner and fish merchant - was happy that he could apply for grants to build new ships, buy safety gear or more fuel-efficient engines. But then he started having misgivings. ""The waters we had could sustain the British fleet,"" says Kurt. ""But then all of a sudden it wasn't just the UK fleet. It was equal access for everyone."" Grimsby fishermen found themselves sharing the sea not only with fishermen from northern Europe, but with those from France, Spain and further afield. In 1983, to preserve fish stocks, a quota system was introduced. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks?Who really owns British fishing quotas?Why France is raising the stakes over fishing For many species, it gave European boats - by law - a greater entitlement to fish in British waters than the British themselves. Prime Minister Edward Heath, who negotiated the UK's entry into the European Economic Community, is widely blamed for this - and for the fact that half a century later, EU fleets land about eight times as much fish (by value) from UK waters as British fishermen catch in EU waters. Within a few years of the introduction of quotas, fishermen like Kurt had reached their annual limit by September and had nothing left to fish for. Some went on the dole, others had to look for new jobs, much to Kurt's disgust.   ""You know, you'd got guys in a cake factory - perfectly brilliant skippers sticking cherries on cakes,"" he says. ""Where does your pride go with that? It's wrong.""  Today, the warren of little streets behind the docks, known as the Kasbah, is eerily quiet. It is overlooked by an eye-catching feat of Victorian engineering, a red brick structure known as Grimsby Dock Tower that once housed the hydraulics that operated dock machinery. Modelled on the Torre del Mangia in Siena, Tuscany, it's Grimsby's equivalent of the Eiffel Tower, adorning tea towels, calendars and coffee mugs. Many of the old warehouses are still standing, but several are boarded up. Another abandoned building was once the world's largest ice factory. It churned out ice blocks by the tonne, which were then crushed up and sent to the dock. Now, the roof's falling in and it's surrounded by a metal fence - a symbol of Grimsby's fall from grandeur. Nearby Freeman Street, once a haunt of the three-day millionaires, has seen better days too. Many businesses are shuttered up, leaving a dreary residue of penny arcades, betting shops and charity outlets. At the back of the covered food market is the office of the local MP, Lia Nici, the daughter of an Italian jazz drummer and a Lincolnshire policewoman. Nici stood in last year's general election, and became the first Conservative to win the Grimsby seat in almost a century.  She was a part of the big story of that election: across the English North and Midlands, seats which had been Labour strongholds for decades fell, turning Britain's so-called ""Red Wall"" blue. These were also the areas where support for leaving the European Union was strongest in the referendum of 2016.  Nici herself actually voted to stay inside the European Union, but now she is reaching out to the 70% of her constituents who voted the other way. ""We have some of the richest fishing grounds in Europe, and we don't have any control,"" she says. ""And that is the reason why people voted for Brexit and voted for Boris Johnson."" Although the UK is now out of the European Union, it remains in its Common Fisheries Policy until the end of this year. Lia Nici insists that, after that, better times lie ahead. ""Come 1 January, we want to be out there. We are ready to go. What we want is a modern trawling industry, so that young people can come into it."" As if to prove this tiny industry's talismanic importance, Boris Johnson donned a white hat, white coat and white rubber boots when he came to Grimsby fishing for votes during the general election campaign. At the fish auction in the docks he posed for selfies clutching a haddock and tweeted about ""taking back control"" of the seas.  Yet there's a precedent for taking back control - and it's relevant to Grimsby's decline. Because even before the UK joined what became the EU, its own fishermen were ejected from the fisheries of another country. The so called ""cod wars"", a series of fishing disputes from the 1950s to 70s, resulted in a 200-mile exclusion zone around Iceland. Ultimately, that rendered Grimsby's deep-sea operators unviable, and they made up the majority of the fleet. This was before European quotas came into existence and dealt a blow to the owners of boats suited to the shallow waters of the North Sea. Today there are only a handful of local fishermen who still land their catch in Grimsby. Down at the dock one evening I meet Darren Kenyon, who started fishing when he was 13 years old.  ""A lot of people got fed up and have packed up,"" he tells me, rolling a soggy cigarette as we stand under a drizzling sky and his crew unloads 30 buckets of crabs and several trays of lobsters, worth a total of £2,000. Darren used to work on the cod fishery but has taken to catching shellfish because they aren't subject to EU quotas. Once the boat is unloaded, Darren takes me into his storehouse to show off his prize lobsters kept in huge shallow tanks. Small inshore operations like his are best at spreading the money around, he says. The crabs he's landed tonight will be boiled up tomorrow at his own dockside workshop, and sold on by stallholders - creating local jobs at each turn. ""If I can fish five days a week,"" he tells me, ""I just about do all right.""  Other fishermen have found different ways to adapt to changing times. Kurt takes me on to the beach at Cleethorpes, just down the road from Grimsby, where I spot the gleaming white blades of wind turbines a few miles offshore. There are plans for hundreds of them, much further out, in what were once fishing grounds, as the UK tries to wean itself off fossil fuels. ""All this,"" he says, pointing out to sea, ""is the future. It's bringing a lot of badly needed investment to our town."" Kurt used his expertise gained over 40 years of managing and owning fishing vessels to found a company called Wind Power Support. His new boats are sent out to transport maintenance equipment and carry passengers to the turbines offshore.  At Grimsby's deep water dock 23-year-old Georgea Cherrell is standing in front of a gigantic orange vessel - so tall that it looks in danger of toppling over. Georgea's a turbine technician for the Danish company, Orsted, which builds and runs the wind farms. Some she can commute to but others, such as Hornsea One, one of the world's largest, are further from the coast, so she and her colleagues stay out at sea for weeks at a time.  ""You have your own cabin and everything that you need on a night time when you get back,"" she says. ""It's like a little community really - you work with them as much as you see your family."" It is not unlike belonging to a trawler crew, except that Georgea's job is steadier and safer. And unlike fishing - which traditionally viewed women on board as bad luck - it welcomes both sexes.  ""I've got a job for life here,"" she tells me. ""We're growing as a company and it's just getting bigger and bigger every single day."" Listen to Lucy Ash's radio documentary, the British and their fish, for Assignment on the BBC World ServiceExplore other episodes of Assignment Shell fisherman Darren Kenyon is not a fan of the wind companies, though. ""It's been a really bad thing for us,"" he says. ""They've taken thousands of miles of sea up, and put wind poles in. They've gridded the sea with electricity cables.""  Darren complains that he cannot compete with the wages the wind farm companies pay their crews. He is also infuriated that the ""wind cats"" - catamarans that take service staff out to the closer turbines - get priority coming in and out of the dock, or so it seems to him. Commercial fishing vessels like his, he says, are kept at the marine equivalent of a long red traffic light.  ""We're just wasting fuel,"" he says. ""And in the summertime, my lobsters especially - they're getting warmer and warmer and warmer.""  Is he looking forward to the UK taking control of its waters from the EU? ""It would be lovely to get our fishing rights back, but we will believe it when we see it because we've been let down year after year, after year, after year,"" he says. ""They say all these things they're going to do - to get people voting for them. Then once they're in, fish will be traded for something else. It's crazy.""  That kind of pessimism still haunts British fisheries, even as the politicians talk of a renaissance. On the coast further north, I meet Danny Normandale, a 48-year-old Grimsby-based fisherman who owns two trawlers. They're just the kind of independent craft that once crammed into harbours up and down the country. But Danny argues those scenes are unlikely ever to return. Any future expansion in the British catch will look very different, he says, simply because of the economics. ""If you buy a second-hand boat such as this one, you might need £600,000,"" he says. ""Then another £600,000 for the licence to put on the boat. So you've already spent £1.2m and that's without the fish quota."" So for an independent fisherman to go into business on his own will be next to impossible, he says. The even bigger question is how the UK can reform the existing quota system. EU quota has become a tradable commodity and its value has soared. According to the environmental group, Greenpeace, just five wealthy UK families own or control nearly a third of the country's fishing quota. Danny complains that the whole system conspires to push small players out. Retiring smaller fishermen have often sold their quota - sometimes to continental Europeans. Others rent out their allocation on a monthly basis; they're known in the trade as ""slipper skippers"" because it's assumed that they sit snug and warm at home while others go fishing.    In fact, Danny has done this himself. It's so hard to make a living from fish, he says, that he's branched out into the energy sector - not wind in his case, but North Sea oil. His boats guard fibre optic cables for oil companies, or protect oil rigs if their lights go out, effectively being a mobile light house for a month at a time.  He doesn't much enjoy the work, however lucrative it may be.  ""It is disappointing. It's not the thrill of the chase any more,"" he says. ""You're not leaving the harbour with 1,000 empty boxes aboard and 20 tonnes of ice, with your mind on the game. The thrill of the hunt - it's no longer there. Now you're going out just thinking that I'm going to go round and round an oil rig for a month and I'm going to get dizzy!"" Danny doesn't plan to fish again until the New Year because he's rented out his quota until then. What the fishing industry will look like in the New Year, no-one knows. At present, around 60% of all the catch landed in the UK's coastal communities goes straight to the continent. So France and the rest of the EU could kill off a British fishing renaissance simply refusing to allow fish landed in Britain to be exported to Europe. One Dutch university study concluded that without a deal, Britain would lose more from tariffs and non-tariff barriers on its fish trade than it would gain from exclusive access to its own waters. ""If you're dealing in a perishable commodity which is going all the way down to Dover to be exported by lorry into France, then you need to move it quickly,"" says Martin Boyers, chief executive of the Grimsby fish market. ""There's nothing in so much of a hurry as a dead fish.""  And while Grimsby may not be much of a fishing town any more it is still very much a fish town. It still excels at filleting and packaging what other people (often Icelanders) catch, before selling it on to make healthy profits. The fish processing industry here now employs some 5,000 people directly. The town is fortunate that most of this fish, once processed, is sold inside the UK. But some Grimsby fish goes to the continent and depends on frictionless trade. The emotional attachment to the fishing industry should not be underestimated. Fish are so much part of the local identity that fans at Grimsby Town Football Club, known as the Mariners, even sing about fishing while they wave inflatable fish over their heads. And Danny and Darren still mourn the lack of small, independent fishermen in Grimsby.  ""We're losing part of our heritage,"" says Danny. ""And I think it's a shame because I'm extremely proud of our heritage."" "
31,Sex and coronavirus: What are the rules?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 11:56:06 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-53736087,,"A new lockdown in England means new guidance around having sex. The guidance says you must not meet socially indoors with anyone unless you live with them, or if they're part of your support bubble.  A support bubble is when a single-adult household joins another household - they can still visit each other and stay overnight. So unless you live with your partner or they're in your chosen bubble, meeting up for sex is off the cards. But the rules differ depending on where in the UK you are. What are the lockdown rules where you are? In Scotland, the new five-tier system means that if your area is on level 0 or 1, you can meet a limited number of people indoors. But if you're in a level 2, 3 or 4 region - there's no meeting indoors with other households.  In Wales, if you live alone you can form a temporary extended household, which means you're allowed to meet indoors and have physical contact.  After the firebreak lockdown in Wales ends on 9 November, two households will be able to form a bubble. The rules for couples in Northern Ireland are the same as those in England - you can only having sex if you live together or are in the same bubble.  The Terrence Higgins Trust published advice in August suggesting people avoid kissing, wear a face covering and choose positions that aren't face-to-face during sex. They say their advice hasn't changed much since then.  ""Your best sexual partner during the Covid-19 pandemic is yourself or someone within your household and you should follow the government guidelines about social distancing, hand washing and face coverings. ""However, it's unrealistic to ask everyone to abstain from sex indefinitely,"" the trust says. Masturbation, sex toys or having phone or online sex are recommended as the safest options. If you are having sex with people outside of your household, it's important to limit the number of partners, it adds.  Like with all parts of life at the moment, be aware of any Covid-19 symptoms you or your partner might have - and isolate if you have them. If you are meeting someone new, the charity says to ask if they or anyone in their household have had symptoms or tested positive. The virus can spread through saliva, mucus or the breath of those who have it, along with contact with hard surfaces. ""If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,"" Dr Alex George told Radio 1 Newsbeat in March. Dr Alex is an A&E doctor and former Love Island contestant and says ""any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth"" increases the risk of passing on coronavirus. That's why the Terrence Higgins Trust recommends not kissing, wearing a face mask during sex and favouring positions where you're not face-to-face. It adds the virus has been found in semen and poo, which is why you should use condoms and dams for oral sex to minimise risk. And given we're supposed to be doing it after most things - washing your hands for more than 20 seconds or using hand sanitiser before and after sex is recommended. Coronavirus and sex: What you need to knowThe great housemate sex dilemmaMaking relationships work during coronavirus All of this is not to say you should forget about your sexual health in general. The charity says it's important to get tested for sexually transmitted infections before starting to have sex again. ""Lockdown has meant that most people have had fewer sexual partners, if any at all, and now is the perfect time to be sure you don't have an STI and to know what your HIV status is,"" it says.

32,US election 2020: Why does the vote matter to people in UK?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 00:25:38 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54707562,,"The US presidential election takes place on 3 November, and the UK will be looking to strike a post-Brexit trade deal with whoever wins. But how might the election result affect us in the UK?  The UK currently trades with the US on terms that were negotiated with the EU. But that will change on 1 January when the UK stops following EU trade rules. Both the US and the UK are negotiating a trade deal, with the aim of making it easier and cheaper to buy and sell goods to each other.  Given that the new presidential term doesn't start until 20 January, a deal is unlikely to be agreed until after then.  And when a deal is agreed depends, in large part, on the will of the next president. How the election with affect US-UK relationsUK-US trade relationship in charts When it comes to UK export destinations, the US is the UK's second biggest market behind the EU. A favourable UK-US trade deal would aim to lower tariffs (taxes paid on imported goods). This could help keep prices down at home, and make it easier to sell things to the US. President Donald Trump, who has called himself ""Mr Brexit"", says he wants a speedy trade deal.  But if Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden wins, this could be a slower process, as he might prioritise repairing US-EU relations. Mr Biden was vice-president to President Barack Obama, who before the 2016 EU referendum said that the UK would be at the ""back of the queue"" in any trade deal with the US, if it voted to leave. That said, there's no guarantee of a quick trade deal no matter who wins the election - the US Congress will have a say, and could stall the process.  Who will be the next US president? You decideWhy we might not get a result on election nightHas Trump delivered on his promises?Full coverage of the US election The UK will be renegotiating how it trades with the US in all areas - and this includes food standards.  Food imported to the UK currently has to meet standards set by the EU, but this won't be the case from 1 January - and new terms will have to be agreed with the US. In 2019, the Trump administration set out some of its priorities in any UK trade deal - and one of these was to allow US agricultural products to be sold to the UK with fewer constraints. Some fear the UK will allow food imports from the US that don't adhere to current food standards. The debate has centred around chicken washed with chlorine - something that's allowed in the US, but not in the UK. The government insists it's committed to high standards, but MPs have so far rejected proposals for imported foods to meet current EU standards. Bid to protect post-Brexit food standards rejectedChlorinated chicken: How safe is it? This leaves the door open for chlorinated chicken and other farming practices that fall below current standards to be on the table in future trade talks. We're not sure on Mr Biden's position, but he apparently told former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg that the US wouldn't sign anything that chicken farmers in the US didn't like. Under the current UK system, experts decide how much the NHS will pay for drugs, but the US pharmaceutical industry wants to have more say over prices, and the Trump administration has also said that this is a priority in negotiations. Mr Biden's position, again, is less clear.  UK negotiators have stated that in any US trade talks: ""The NHS will not be on the table. The price the NHS pays for drugs will not be on the table."" There's also another important political dimension to any deal with the US - the Irish border. Last year the UK and EU signed a deal, called the withdrawal agreement, which paved the way for Brexit to happen. It included a plan to prevent checks along the Irish border from January 2021, which is when the new UK-EU relationship will start. But the issue has resurfaced after the UK government said it wanted to make changes to the previously agreed arrangement. Mr Biden - a man with Irish roots - has made his position clear, tweeting that any trade deal with the UK must be contingent upon ""preventing a return to a hard border"" with Ireland and ""respect"" for the Good Friday Agreement. He says he wouldn't allow peace in Northern Ireland to become a ""casualty of Brexit"". This is similar to the position taken by the Trump administration, which has said it wants to ""see the lack of a border maintained"". The Irish lobby is powerful in US politics, and it would seem either administration would push back against any changes along the border.  "

34,How I talk to the victims of conspiracy theories,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 00:45:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-54738471,,"Sebastian's mum is one of the leaders of Britain's conspiracy community. He spoke exclusively to the BBC's specialist disinformation reporter Marianna Spring about the impact that his mother is having on public health - and their relationship. It was a sunny autumn morning when I opened up my inbox to see a message from someone called Sebastian.  I recognised his distinctive surname immediately. The day before, I had been covering anti-lockdown protests in central London. Sebastian's mum, Kate Shemirani, was one of the headline speakers. A week later, the weather had turned. Drenched from a torrential downpour, I found myself sitting in a dimly-lit London basement opposite Sebastian. He's a 21-year-old university student studying philosophy and politics. He seemed nervous - but determined. He told me he felt a duty to speak out, for the sake of public health, and for others whose loved ones may be going down a similar path. Over the course of three hours he detailed how his mum had gained a huge online following by spreading falsehoods about the pandemic. She's denied that coronavirus exists, alleges that the government is planning a mass genocide, and has compared the National Health Service to Nazi Germany. Her views - broadcast to tens of thousands of online followers and often repeated by even larger accounts - threaten to undermine critical public health messages. But for Sebastian, it was also an intensely personal story.  Conspiracy theories were his childhood lullabies. Starting from when he was about 10 or 11, he says, he was shown YouTube videos about secret plots and given books about ""lizard people"".  Sebastian got good grades and ended up going to a private boarding school. The time away from his family resulted in him challenging his mum's baseless claims.  He described to me in heartbreaking detail the breakdown of their relationship. He left home when he was 17, and these days the little interaction he has with his mother comes via text message. ""There's no way for me to talk to her at all because she's completely obsessed,"" he said. ""When this is over … and everything she said is forgotten and the 'global genocide' hasn't happened, people will forget about it,"" he told me. ""But the disaster that goes on within my family… that stuff stays forever.""  BBC Trending In-depth reporting on social media and online culture. Listen to our podcast - from the BBC World Service. I've spent a lot of time this year covering the human impact of conspiracy theories - from the pro-Trump movement QAnon to the explosion in coronavirus misinformation.  In the summer, I interviewed Brian, a man in Florida who believed false claims that Covid-19 was a ""hoax"". His precise views shifted around. Sometimes he thought the virus wasn't real - other times he believed that it was totally harmless, or at least no more deadly than the flu. Throughout the pandemic, he more or less carried on as normal, until both he and his wife caught the disease and ended up in hospital. He survived; she died.  Sebastian's was one of thousands of messages I've received since, from people who fear they are losing loved ones down the rabbit hole of online conspiracy.  I always stress that there are legitimate concerns about the effects of lockdown measures on mental health, education and the economy. Reporting on conspiracy theories is not about clamping down on healthy political discussion. And of course there are valid debates about the still-developing science. There's a lot about this virus that we just don't know. What is QAnon?The human cost of virus misinformationWhat links coronavirus myths and QAnon? But the kinds of stories I hear about are something else entirely.  They are tales of sinister plots - supposed plans to implant microchips in the world's population and kill and enslave billions. Or completely unscientific ideas - that the virus somehow ""doesn't exist"" and that the health authorities are completely wrong.  Unfortunately, some people are so entranced by these fictions that that they lose their grip on reality. Some take it to extremes. I've been sent abuse, even death threats. But what about those who are only starting down that path? I've been trying to answer a key question that keeps popping up in my inbox: how do you talk to people who are at risk of buying into dark fantasies? The experts I've spoken to suggest some answers. First of all, try not to cut the person off. Address the issue as soon as possible - but do it with empathy.  Many of us are feeling very anxious about the pandemic, and conspiracy theories give simple, satisfying answers to a problem that seems overwhelmingly complex.  Psychologists like Jovan Byford from the Open University tell me that a good strategy is to try to get to the bottom of the person's legitimate concerns and to find out how they are feeling.   Depending on how wedded they are to conspiracies, this can be a long process.  ""Sit them down and just discuss it for hours until they realise what they're saying is not true,"" Sebastian suggests. ""If you don't nip it in the bud, it will grow and grow.""  Another tip is to try to figure out where the person is getting their information. Are they quoting a fringe YouTube video (which may have been fact-checked and debunked), or people in the echo chamber of a conspiracy-minded Facebook group?  Present facts and evidence neutrally, the experts say. Rational questions can provoke reflection, and critical thinking. And always listen to people's deeper concerns. In the week since we first aired my interview with Sebastian (you can watch it above or listen here), Kate Shemirani's Twitter account has been suspended for violating the site's rules on sharing harmful coronavirus misinformation. When we put her son's claims to Ms Shemirani, she did not directly respond, but did tell us: ""From what I can see it would appear a 'conspiracy theorist' is actually now anyone who believes something other than what your controllers want them to believe... I find this deeply disturbing"". Sebastian's story captured the attention of people across the world. He hopes that other families might be spared the pain that his has suffered.

41,US election 2020: What to look out for on election night,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:32:05 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54723228,," On 3 November, Americans will head to the polls and send either Joe Biden or Donald Trump to the White House. Here's what to watch for as an unpredictable election night unfolds, and the results roll in.  To become US president, you don't actually need to win the popular vote. Instead, candidates are aiming to win the majority in something called the electoral college (more on that below)Millions more Americans are voting by mail than in previous elections. Counting postal votes can take more time, and some states won't start until polling day, so there will almost certainly be delays for some results.And because of this unprecedented surge of postal votes, a candidate who takes an early lead may end up being overtaken as postal or in-person votes are tallied. So be wary of the numbers.  Bellwether state: Places like Ohio and Missouri where voters have proven reliable at choosing the national winnerExit poll: Interviews with voters after they have voted. Only a small number of voters are interviewed, so the exit poll result can turn out to be different to the official count.Electoral college:  Each state gets a number of electors, roughly in proportion to its population. In most cases, whichever candidate wins a state also wins all that state's electors, who meet later to choose the president and vice-president. Because there are 538 electoral college votes, each candidate needs 270 to win. There's a full explanation of the system here.Projecting winners: This is what the night is all about but how does it work? It's a combination of in-person interviews with voters at polling stations, telephone interviews with early voters and actual votes counted in precincts. Major US networks will project (they may use the term ""call"") winners of states when all this data shows a candidate has an unbeatable lead. In all cases, these are predictions and not official results, which usually take weeks. (More on projecting below) Swing state or battleground state: These states lack a clear party affiliation, meaning they are up for grabs for both Democratic and Republican candidates. Red state v blue state: These states tend to vote with a particular party - Republicans in red states and Democrats in blue.  The influx of postal ballots this year will make it hard to see who's in the lead early on.  Different states have different rules for how - and when - to count postal ballots, meaning there will be large gaps between them in terms of reporting results. Some states, like Florida and Arizona, begin pre-processing ballots weeks before 3 November. Others, like Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, won't touch these votes until election day, meaning they'll likely be slower to count.  To add to the confusion, states differ in their deadlines for when to accept postal ballots. Some, like Georgia, will only count ballots received on or before 3 November, while others, like Ohio, will count late ballots as long as they are postmarked by 3 November.  We know for certain that in some states it will take weeks to get complete results, meaning it will be nearly impossible to predict when we can name the next president.  Why early voting is so popular in the US electionWhy it can be hard to vote in the US This hasn't been the case in past elections, when you could typically set your watch to the 23:00 EST (04:00 GMT) closure of West Coast polls. In 2008, results came right on the hour and in 2012 they were just 15 minutes after that.  The last time around, however, it wasn't until Donald Trump clinched Pennsylvania deep into election night - 01:35 EST (06:35 GMT) - that his victory over Hillary Clinton was considered inevitable.  Firstly, early tallies may be deceptive.  This is due in part to more differences between states in reporting. In some states, ballots cast in person on election day will be counted first. These counts are expected to favour Mr Trump, as his supporters are expected to be more likely to vote on the day. In other places, postal votes cast prior to 3 November will be reported first or included in early counts along with day-of votes. Initial results from these states may favour Mr Biden, as Democrats are more likely than Republicans to vote by mail this year.  There's also the looming concern of electoral fraud - a common refrain from the Trump campaign.  Importantly, instances of electoral fraud are incredibly rare, and there is no evidence that postal ballots are especially susceptible. Overall, the rate of voting fraud in the US is between 0.00004% and 0.0009%, according to a 2017 study by the Brennan Center for Justice.  After the polls close, major US media outlets will be using election models to estimate who will win all the different races. The models draw on a variety of data such as exit polls (interviews with voters at polling stations, phone interviews with early voters) and actual votes counted by local officials and then fed into a database.   A state will be ""projected"" (you may hear the term ""called"" as well) by these media outlets when they believe a candidate has an unassailable lead. Some describe it as a 99.5% certainty. This year, the BBC gets its data from polling firm Edison Research who do the field work for the exit polls and work with US networks in the National Election Pool. The watchword from all this year is caution - there is no race to be first. If the BBC and its partners don't believe there is enough data to project a winner of any state, we won't do so - even if others are. How you can be US president without winning most votesWho will be next US president? You decide The same is true when the presidential election is called, or projected, for a candidate. It will take weeks for states to count all the ballots and that has always been the case but even more likely this time due to postal voting.  Last time around, in 2016, Hillary Clinton's lead in the popular vote widened for more than a month after election day as officials counted ballots, many from California, even though Mr Trump had already won enough states to claim the presidency.  Tens of millions of postal ballots will be cast in this year's election - perhaps double the number in 2016. There were concerns that the sheer volume of mail-in ballots would overwhelm the country's postal service, delaying delivery and receipt by state officials. But the postal service has assured that's not the case. Some states will accept ballots that arrive well after election day - as long as they are postmarked on or before 3 November - which will further slow down the count.  And once they have arrived, postal votes take longer to count than in-person ballots. Postal ballots must be manually removed from their envelopes and verified as valid before they can be tabulated.  Why we might have to wait for the US election results If there are no clear results on 3 November we'll have to wait days - or weeks - for vote counting to finish up.  This is normal - votes are typically tallied late on election night and early into the next day. But we're expecting it to take even longer this year.   Plus, there could be legal disputes which will add to the uncertainty and could mean the courts play a part. We know that final results will be slow, but there are still some states that may give us early clues. The first swing state to report its first tranche could be Georgia, where polls close at 19:00 EST (midnight GMT) and then half an hour later it's North Carolina at 19:30 EST (00:30 GMT), where a large number of early in-person voters means projections could come quickly. Here, the overwhelming majority of results are expected by the end of the night. Donald Trump narrowly won this state in 2016 and it is a toss-up between parties once again. A win here for Mr Trump or Mr Biden could mean a good night ahead.  Soon after, at 20:00 EST (01:00 GMT) the last polls will close in Ohio and Florida. Ohio is not just a swing state, it is also a presidential fortune-teller: it has backed the winner at every presidential contest bar one since World War Two. But if it's close in Ohio, don't expect a projected winner on the night. Florida is perhaps the night's biggest prize, and we expect the first set of results to be announced shortly after 20:30 EST (01:30 GMT). White House races have been won and lost in this battleground state, and the same may be true this year. A note of caution - early in-person and postal ballots will be reported first in Florida and these will likely favour Mr Biden. Another titan of US elections is Texas. Like Georgia, it's rarely considered Democratic territory but demographical trends mean Texas has moved closer in their direction over recent years. Polls close at 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) and we should get plenty of results from counties there through the night. Is Florida key to this election?  And at 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT), polls will shutter in Arizona, where officials began counting ballots on 20 October. Mail ballots that arrived after 1 November will not be counted until after election day, so if this state is close a projection will be slow. Trump was victorious here in 2016, but national polls now give Mr Biden a razor's-edge lead.  In a number of other states, officials will not count a single ballot until 3 November. So expect a wait. Polls in Pennsylvania will shutter at 20:00 EST (01:00 GMT) on election day. Both candidates' likely path to the White House will run through this battleground state, the place where Mr Biden was born and which Mr Trump won in 2016 by a single percentage point. Legal challenges may be likely in this crucial state.  In both Wisconsin and Michigan, polls will close at 21:00 EST (02:00 GMT). Democrats have been hard at work in Wisconsin after Hillary Clinton's narrow loss there in 2016. Many polls now give Mr Biden the lead, but the state is still up for grabs. The most populous county Milwaukee is due in the early hours of Wednesday. Neighbouring Michigan -  another swing state - will also be closely watched, but a projection there could be days away. Biden and Trump aren't the only two people on the ballot.  Both parties will be paying close attention to elections for the US Senate - where Republicans currently hold a three-seat advantage.  Trump ally Lindsey Graham is in the fight of his political life in South Carolina, facing a stiff challenge from Democrat Jaime Harrison. Mr Graham, has held this seat since 2003, but he has turned away some voters with his staunch loyalty to the president. Final polls give Mr Graham a two-point edge, and he is still favourite to win but the narrow margin was unexpected and suggests there is plenty anti-Trump sentiment in a typically conservative state.  Read about the five Senate races to watch  In Maine, Republican Susan Collins may soon be out of a job. Ms Collins is one of the few moderate members of her party in office right now, but she still may be punished for her affiliation to the president in a state where he is deeply unpopular.  And that's not all. Americans will also weigh in on more than 100 ballot measures. In California, a referendum is looking to overturn a law which eliminates cash bail entirely, and replaces it with a pre-trial risk assessment.  Marijuana is on the ballot in Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota, where voters could legalise cannabis for recreation purposes. Similarly, in Mississippi, voters may cast their ballots to approve marijuana for medical purposes.

43,US Election 2020: When will we get a result and could it be contested?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 17:45:46 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54096399,,"After polls close in the US presidential election, it could take days or even weeks to find out if Donald Trump or Joe Biden has won.  In this election, millions more Americans have been voting by post because of coronavirus, meaning a delay in counting all the votes is highly likely. The result is usually called on the night of election day, which this year is Tuesday 3 November. Different states stop voting at different times. The first polls close on the East Coast at 19:00 local time (00:00 GMT). This is followed by a running total of votes as they are reported in each state.  The full count is never completed on election night - but enough votes are usually in to confirm a winner.  A state is ""called"" by major US media outlets when they believe one candidate has an unbeatable lead.  But at this stage, when most but not all of the votes will have been counted, this is a projection, not the final result. How the electoral college worksA really simple guide to the US election US presidents are not decided by the national vote, but by winning enough states. The winner in each state takes a certain number of ""electoral votes"" based roughly on the size of its population.  To win the White House, 270 electoral votes are needed. In 2016, the election was called for Donald Trump at about 02:30 EST (07:30 GMT), after victory in Wisconsin put him over the 270. The coronavirus pandemic means more people than ever are voting early, either by post or in person. Postal votes typically take longer to count as they have to go through more steps to be verified, such as a signature and address check. Some states, such as Florida and Ohio, allow this process to start weeks before election day, so the votes are ready to be counted.  In these states, it may be possible to call a winner on election night, depending on how close the races are. But other states, such as Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, don't allow early votes to be processed until polling day.  These states could be crucial - and election officials have said counts could take days. Do postal ballots lead to voting fraud? The way certain states process votes is also likely to skew early counts:  In states that wait until election day to process postal votes, initial numbers are likely to favour President Trump as more Republicans are expected to vote in person on polling day and these votes will be quicker to countIn states that process early votes before election day, the initial numbers are expected to favour Mr Biden as more registered Democrats than Republicans have voted early This is why election officials have warned the early results may not provide the full picture.  There have been delays in other polls this year - the 23 states that had held election contests after mid-March had taken an average of four days to report nearly complete results, a Washington Post analysis found. About half of states will accept postal ballots that arrive after election day, as long as they are postmarked by 3 November, so some votes won't be counted until days after the election. There's also expected to be a rise in provisional ballots - votes cast by people who requested a postal ballot but decided to vote in person instead.  And these won't be included in the initial count, as they require checks to ensure people don't vote twice. Millions of people will still be turning up to vote on election day - but fewer polling stations than usual will be open partly because of coronavirus considerations, and concerns have been raised about worker shortages, meaning long queues are likely. Familiar problems such as faulty voting machines could also cause delays. Most ballots - paper or digital - are counted by machines. But poll workers need to check any paper ballots the machines fail to process. After polls close, the voting data will be transferred to a central election headquarters - a city hall or similar location.  Sometimes, this is done electronically. But elsewhere, memory devices holding the voting data must be physically delivered or the results read out over the phone. Once the vote tallies are delivered, they'll often start to show up on a state's official website.  In other cases, journalists are told the tallies by state election officials and report these results.  When enough votes have been tallied from across a state to determine an unbeatable lead, news organisations call a winning presidential candidate for that state.  These unofficial results are certified only weeks later, when confirmed by state officials. The final vote tallies can shift between the first count and these certified results but not drastically. The pandemic has already led to more than 300 election law cases in 44 states, according the Stanford-MIT healthy-elections project. And the presidential vote could see legal challenges over everything from identification requirements for postal voting to Covid-related changes to polling systems. President Trump says the election result could end up in the US Supreme Court.  In 2000, Democrat Al Gore lost Florida and the presidential election by 537 out of a total of almost six million votes.  And this was followed by a highly controversial recount process that lasted over a month - and the Supreme Court ruling in favour of Republican George W Bush.

45,US election 2020 polls: Who is ahead - Trump or Biden?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 22:06:01 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-53657174,,"Voters in America will decide on 3 November whether Donald Trump remains in the White House for another four years. The Republican president is being challenged by Democratic Party nominee Joe Biden, who is best known as Barack Obama's vice-president but has been in US politics since the 1970s.  As election day approaches, polling companies will be trying to gauge the mood of the nation by asking voters which candidate they prefer.  We'll be keeping track of those polls here and trying to work out what they can and can't tell us about who will win the election.  National polls are a good guide as to how popular a candidate is across the country as a whole, but they're not necessarily a good way to predict the result of the election.  In 2016, for example, Hillary Clinton led in the polls and won nearly three million more votes than Donald Trump, but she still lost - that's because the US uses an electoral college system, so winning the most votes doesn't always win you the election.  With that caveat aside, Joe Biden has been ahead of Donald Trump in most national polls since the start of the year. He has hovered around 50% in recent months and has had a 10-point lead on occasions.  By contrast, in 2016 the polls were far less clear and just a couple of percentage points separated Mr Trump and his rival in the days before the election.   A really simple guide to the US electionHow will early voting impact the election? As Mrs Clinton discovered in 2016, the number of votes you win is less important than where you win them.   Most states nearly always vote the same way, meaning that in reality there are just a handful of states where both candidates stand a chance of winning. These are the places where the election will be won and lost and are known as battleground states.  In the electoral college system the US uses to elect its president, each state is given a number of votes based on how many members it sends to Congress - House and Senate. A total of 538 electoral college votes are up for grabs, so a candidate needs to hit 270 to win.  As the map above shows, some battleground states have a lot more electoral college votes on offer than others so candidates often spend a lot more time campaigning in them.  What is the electoral college?Predict the president: Play our game At the moment, polls in the battleground states look good for Joe Biden - although the margins have tightened in recent days. Mr Biden appears to have decent leads in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin - three industrial states his Republican rival won by margins of less than 1% to clinch victory in 2016.  But it's the battleground states where Mr Trump won big in 2016 that his campaign team will be most worried about. His winning margin in Iowa, Ohio and Texas was between 8-10% back then but it's currently looking much closer in all three.  That's one of the reasons why some political analysts rate his chances of re-election as low as things stand.  The Economist thinks Mr Biden is ""very likely"" to beat Mr Trump while FiveThirtyEight, a political analysis website, sees Mr Biden as ""favoured"" to win the election but says the president could still come out on top.   How to follow the results on the BBCWhat has Trump said about your country? Donald Trump and Joe Biden went head-to-head in two live TV debates. The first, on 29 September, was a chaotic affair, with Mr Trump's combative approach stamping out any chance of a real debate.  A CBS News/YouGov poll taken straight afterwards suggested it was a good night for Mr Biden.  Of those who watched, 48% said Mr Biden was the winner while 41% went for Mr Trump - a similar split to national polling averages. Nearly 70% of people said the debate made them feel ""annoyed"".  In the second debate, on 22 October, organisers introduced a mute button to help police the arguments.  But it was a much more restrained President Trump on show and there was a much greater focus on the policies of the two candidates.  While that seemed to help Mr Trump somewhat, snap polls still suggested viewers thought Mr Biden's performance was more impressive.  A CNN poll found 53% of viewers thought the Democrat had done a better job in the debate, while 39% went with Mr Trump.  A YouGov snap poll was similar, with 54% saying Mr Biden had won compared to 35% for the president.  So while Mr Trump put in a better performance, it's unlikely to have been enough to change the balance of the race on its own.  Key takeaways from the Trump-Biden showdown We only had a couple of days to mull over the first debate before President Trump's bombshell tweet in the early hours of 2 October revealed he and the first lady had tested positive for coronavirus.  While the pandemic has dominated headlines in the US since the start of the year, the focus had shifted to the Supreme Court after the death of long-serving Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in September.  So Mr Trump's positive coronavirus test put his response to the pandemic, which has claimed the lives of more than 230,000 people in the US, back under the spotlight.  According to data from an ABC News/Ipsos poll, just 35% of Americans approve of how the president has handled the crisis. That figure climbs among Republicans, but only to 76%.  On his own health, 72% of respondents said that Mr Trump did not take the ""risk of contracting the virus seriously enough,"" while the same number said he failed to take ""the appropriate precautions when it came to his personal health"". A similar Yahoo News/YouGov poll found that about half of respondents believed he could have avoided contracting the disease altogether if he had practised greater social distancing and worn a face mask.  Why are Covid-19 infections rising again in US? It's easy to dismiss the polls by saying they got it wrong in 2016 and President Trump frequently does exactly that. But it's not entirely true.  Most national polls did have Hillary Clinton ahead by a few percentage points, but that doesn't mean they were wrong, since she won three million more votes than her rival. Pollsters did have some problems in 2016 - notably a failure to properly represent voters without a college degree - meaning Mr Trump's advantage in some key battleground states wasn't spotted until late in the race, if at all. Most polling companies have corrected this now. But this year there's even more uncertainty than normal due to the coronavirus pandemic and the effect it's having on both the economy and how people will vote in November, so all polls should be read with some scepticism.

You decide,"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 16:35:15 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54286528,,"This year's US presidential election could come down to results in just a few key states. Most states are tipped to vote one way or another - so we have already assigned 188 votes to Mr Trump and 233 to Mr Biden. Can Joe Biden wrestle enough away to seize the presidency? Or will Donald Trump romp home to a second term? It's all about the race to 270 electoral votes - and this time you decide. Click here if you can't see the interactive In the US election system, it's the state-level results that count. Each state has a number of electoral votes, based on population, and many reliably vote the same way each time. Two independent American sources, Real Clear Politics and The Cook Political Report, publish lists of states grouped by how they are expected to vote on election night. Several states are classified as ""toss-ups"", which means they could be won by either side. We chose our seven key states from those toss-ups which have enough electoral votes to sway the final outcome and where we expect the battle to be fought most closely. President Trump won all of them in 2016 Since most states are already tipped to vote one way or another, we've assigned their respective electoral votes to the candidate that each is considered most likely to vote for. This means the game starts at 188 votes for Mr Trump and 233 for Mr Biden. Technically, yes. There are a total of 538 electoral college votes and it is possible for two candidates to win states in such a way that each will come out with 269 votes. Awkward. It's also possible for no candidate to receive a majority. To determine a single winner, the US House of Representatives will vote for the next president and the US Senate will vote for the next vice-president. This is so rare, though, that it's only happened a few times in US history… and not since the 19th Century.

47,US election 2020: What are Trump's and Biden's policies?,"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 15:14:28 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54507550,,"American voters will face a clear choice for president on election day, between Republican incumbent Donald Trump and Democratic hopeful Joe Biden. Here's a look at what they stand for and how their policies compare on eight key issues. President Trump set up a coronavirus task force at the end of January which he says has now shifted its focus to ""safety and opening up our country"". The president is also prioritising the speedy development of coronavirus treatments and vaccines, directing $10bn towards such projects. Mr Biden wants to set up a national contact-tracing programme, establish at least 10 testing centres in every state, and provide free coronavirus testing to all. He supports a nationwide mask mandate, which would require face coverings to be worn on federal property. A simple guide to the US election President Trump is a climate change sceptic, and wants to expand non-renewable energy. He aims to increase drilling for oil and gas, and roll back further environmental protections. He has committed to withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord - the international agreement on tackling climate change - which the US will formally leave later this year. Mr Biden says he would immediately re-join the Paris climate agreement if elected. He wants the US to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and proposes banning new leases for oil and gas drilling on public lands, as well as a $2tn investment in green energy. How election could decide battle against climate change President Trump has pledged to create 10 million jobs in 10 months, and create one million new small businesses. He wants to deliver an income tax cut, and provide companies with tax credits to incentivise them to keep jobs in the US. Mr Biden wants to raise taxes for high earners to pay for investment in public services, but says the increase will only impact those earning over $400,000 a year. He supports raising the federal minimum wage to $15 (£11.50) an hour from the current rate of $7.25 (£5.50). Trump economy in six charts President Trump wants to repeal the Affordable Care Act (ACA) passed under President Obama, which increased the federal government's regulation of the private health insurance system, including making it illegal to deny coverage for people with pre-existing medical conditions. He says he wants to improve and replace it, although no details of the plan have been published. The president also aims to lower drug prices by allowing imports of cheaper ones from abroad. Mr Biden wants to protect and expand the ACA. He wants to lower the eligibility age for Medicare, the policy which provides medical benefits to the elderly, from 65 to 60. He also wants to give all Americans the option to enrol in a public health insurance plan similar to Medicare. Four lives depending on 'Obamacare' President Trump has reiterated his promise to bring down US troop levels overseas, while continuing to invest in the military. The president says he will continue to challenge international alliances and maintain trade tariffs on China. Mr Biden has promised to repair relationships with US allies. He says he would do away with unilateral tariffs on China, and instead hold them accountable with an international coalition that China ""can't afford to ignore"". How would Biden change US foreign policy? President Trump says he doesn't believe racism is a systemic problem within US police forces. He has positioned himself as a firm advocate of law enforcement, but has opposed chokeholds and offered grants for improved practices. Mr Biden views racism as a systemic problem, and has set out policies to address racial disparities in the justice system, such as grants to incentivise states in reducing incarceration rates. He has rejected calls to defund police, saying additional resources should instead be tied to maintaining proper standards. Seven solutions to US police problems      President Trump has an expansive interpretation of the US constitution's Second Amendment protections giving Americans the right to bear arms. He did propose tightening background checks on gun buyers after a string of mass shootings in 2019, but nothing came of the plan and no further legislation has been put forward. Mr Biden has proposed banning assault weapons, universal background checks, limiting the number of guns a person can purchase to one per month, and making it easier to sue negligent gun manufacturers and sellers. He would also fund more research into preventing gun violence. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? President Trump says it's his constitutional right to fill the vacancy on the court during the remainder of his first term in office, and has put forward conservative judge, Amy Coney Barrett. One issue that the Supreme Court could soon rule on is the legal right to abortion in the US - something the president and Judge Barrett have opposed in the past. Mr Biden wants the vacancy to be filled after the next president enters office. He says if elected he would work to pass legislation to guarantee a woman's right to an abortion if the Supreme Court rules against it. What is the US Supreme Court?

48,US election 2020: Does climate change impact the vote?,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 18:43:16 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-us-2020-54727388,,"Climate change is one of the many issues driving voters to the polls - especially young people. We asked members of our voter panel how climate change impacts how they will vote. Here's what they said. A scientist by training, Annie Passarello is a teacher and tour guide who sees the impact of climate change first-hand in her state. Concerned by the divisiveness in the country, she is voting for Joe Biden this November. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? As an Alaskan, climate change is on my front doorstep. But it's not just the loss of wildlife and fish habitat and the growing number of forest fires that concern us. It's the loss of a way of life, it's the loss of culture. Many Alaskans engage in subsistence hunting and fishing to some extent and have for thousands of years, which is being lost as a result of the impacts of climate change. Those losses impact our economy as the land and waters of Alaska have always provided so much life for us, and when they are diminished the quality of our life is diminished. Tell us about your plan to vote. I plan to walk the two blocks down my dirt road and vote at the fire station. Jim Hurson is a Vietnam veteran and semi-retired small business owner who is unhappy the two major parties cannot work together for the good of the country. His home was destroyed in 2017 in the Great Tubbs Fire. He is concerned about the impact of climate change, but says neither party has viable ideas to address the problem. He plans to vote for President Trump. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? I find it hard to grasp how anyone can fail to comprehend the dangers of climate change, which I consider to be one facet of our national security issue. That said, none of the viable political parties will properly acknowledge the fundamental environmental problem which is population. The Republicans are in deep denial but the Democrats want to throw the borders open and make the problem much worse. Mr Biden said in the last debate that he wants to amnesty 11 million people now in the country illegally. Ms Harris wants to go well beyond that. It's an insane basis for any environmental policy! Tell us about your plan to vote. I will deliver my ballot in person on election day. Deanna Lusk is a legal assistant and moderate voter from the Midwest. After twice voting for Barack Obama, she voted for Donald Trump in 2016. Although she is not a fan of his style, she believes he has made decisions that have been beneficial to the country and plans to vote for him again on election day. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? Biden's latest comments on climate change are pivotal. He laid out a plan with regard to changes on fracking and the oil sector, and that was a big deal to a lot of people. The changes he's going to try and make right away are going to negatively impact the economy. It's probably going to take more than twenty years to make it right if he does make these changes. For me, I feel like we now have a peek through the curtain that hides the circus. Kamala Harris wants the Green New Deal, which contains a lot of huge changes. I think Biden is just going to go along with other people's decisions. Tell us about your plan to vote. I plan to vote as I have always voted, at the polling station. I don't understand what the panic is all about. I will never change the way I vote, it should be protected. Chris Badillo is a progressive first-time voter who is extremely concerned by the lack of action on climate change. Angered by President Trump's actions on immigration and the environment, he supports Joe Biden. How does the issue of climate change impact your vote? President Trump believes that man-made climate change is a hoax. He has cut funding to the Environmental Protection Agency and has utilised his administration to deregulate industries, putting the profits of fossil fuel CEOs above our country's future. Living in Miami, I know that my community will be the first to feel the effects of climate change. Joe Biden has committed to signing executive orders that will help move us to net-zero emissions and make an unprecedented federal investment in combating climate change, which Donald Trump actively opposes. Climate change is an existential threat to the future of my generation, and Joe Biden's policies take some of the necessary steps to mitigate its effects. Tell us about your plan to vote. I voted by mail in Miami, Florida, and the online system from my local election department confirmed that my vote has already been counted.

52,Coronavirus: What are the social distancing rules?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:39:29 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51506729,,"Social distancing is a key method of keeping people safe and preventing the spread of Covid-19. It means keeping a certain distance away from other people to lessen the risk of passing on - or catching - coronavirus. Check the rules where you liveHow does England's three-tier system work? Each nation has slightly different advice:  In Scotland people should keep 2m away from each other. Shops are reintroducing measures to support 2m physical distancing, like one-way systems. There are exemptions in some places like pubs, and children aged 11 or under do not need to social distanceIn England, if you can't stay 2m away, you can stay ""1m plus"" apart (the ""plus"" means doing something else to limit possible exposure, like wearing a face covering)In Wales, the guidance is to stay 2m apart unless it is not practical (for instance, at a hairdresser's); primary-age children in Wales are also exemptNorthern Ireland's guidance was 1m (3ft) for a time, but is now back at 2m Social distancing is important because coronavirus spreads mainly when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks, and transmits small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air.  These droplets can land in other people's mouths or noses nearby or may be inhaled into the lungs. You could also be infected after touching a surface on which the droplets have landed. The risks are far higher indoors than outdoors Social distancing is a key element of meeting others safely. The only people you do not need to socially distance from are: People in your householdAnyone in your support bubble, if you have oneYour partner in an established relationship Otherwise, when seeing anybody else you must: Follow social distancing rulesAvoid physical contact like a handshake or hugNot be too close or face-to-faceNot shout or sing too close to them Different restrictions apply across the UK. In England, people living in tier three (very high) Covid alert level areas cannot mix with other households or support bubbles under most circumstances.  Households in tier two (high) alert areas can only mix with others outdoors, in groups of six or fewer. Residents in tier one (medium) alert areas can meet in groups of six indoors or outdoors. In all cases, social distancing guidelines must be followed. However, from 5 November the country will be under a national lockdown, during which nobody can meet anyone from outside their household or support bubble indoors. They can meet one other person in an outdoor public place, such as a park. Scotland is moving to a five-tier system of restrictions from Monday, with rules about meeting people different at each level. Wales is in a national circuit-breaker lockdown until 9 November, which means people are not allowed to mix with other households or meet people they do not live with. However, adults living alone or single parents can join with one other household for support anywhere in Wales.  After the lockdown, two households in Wales will be able to form a bubble and will be able to meet in their own homes, while up to 15 people will be allowed to meet for organised activities indoors, and up to 30 outdoors. People living in Northern Ireland are also currently under restrictions. Support bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people from two households.

53,Support bubbles: How do they work and who is in yours?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 15:20:52 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52637354,,"Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. The rules vary across the country, so what is the situation where you live? A bubble is defined as a group of people with whom you have close physical contact.  In England, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household.  The second household can be of any size and can include ""at risk"" people who were previously shielding. Wherever possible, the government recommends that a support bubble should be with another local household to avoid unnecessary travel. What tier is my area in? Support bubbles will be allowed to continue during the planned lockdown, which starts on Thursday. Bubbles must be ""exclusive"". Once in one, you can't switch and start another with a different household. People in each bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. Anyone in the bubble contacted as part of England's test and trace programme must stay at home. If they develop coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. Under the current three-tier system, people have been allowed to form support bubbles with those who live in an area with a higher rating. However, the government says people should try to minimise contact with those in their support bubble if it involves travel to or from a very high (Tier 3) area.    Bubbles can be cross-border with Scotland and Wales, subject to local restrictions.  As well as the support bubble rules, the government in England also has a set of rules that apply to families with children under 14 (as well as to vulnerable adults).  They can form a childcare bubble with one other household to provide informal (unpaid and unregistered) childcare. This must always be between the same two households. This will still be possible when the lockdown starts in England on Thursday. However, the Cabinet Office has been unable to confirm to the BBC whether one or more people from the second household can provide the childcare - so in the case of grandparents, for example, whether only one of them can do it. Two single people each living alone could bubbleSomeone in a houseshare could bubble - but their housemates wouldn't be allowed to form their own bubbles with other people Full government guidelines for England are here. In August, people in Wales were given the go-ahead to form an ""extended household"" with up to three other households. Members of the extended household were able to meet indoors in groups of up to six at any one time - not including children younger than 11 - and have physical contact. They could also stay in each other's homes, or form an extended household with another in England. Since then, restrictions have been reintroduced, and extended households have been unable to meet.  From 23 October until 9 November, the Welsh government is imposing a ""circuit breaker"" lockdown, during which people have been told to stay at home and not mix with anyone they do not live with, either indoors or outdoors. However, adults living alone, including single parent households, can still meet one other household of any size indoors. When the ''circuit breaker'' ends, two households of any size will be able to form a bubble and will be able to meet in their own homes.  Since 19 June, people in Scotland who live on their own or only with children under 18 have been able to form an extended household with people from one other household. Extended households can continue to meet at home under the new rules being introduced on 2 November. This group of people can visit each other's homes and go inside. They do not have to stay 2m (6ft) apart and can stay overnight.  Households can only be a part of one extended group - you can't switch and start another with a different household. People in extended households are counted as one household, and so can continue to meet and socialise with each other despite general restrictions on households mixing.  Couples who do not live together can also form an extended household, which can include any children they each live with.  If any member of an extended household develops symptoms or tests positive for Covid, everyone in the bubble must self-isolate. Initially, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children were under 18 - were allowed to form a support bubble with one other household.  The rules were later changed to allow two full households to form a bubble.  Members of the bubble are treated as one household and can spend time indoors and stay overnight with each other.  Under the latest restrictions, bubbles are limited to a maximum of 10 people from two households.  Read more from the Northern Ireland Executive here. Schools are using year group and/or class bubbles to support social distancing and reduce close contact between pupils as much as possible.  Maintaining distinct groups which do not mix makes it quicker and easier when a positive case occurs to identify those who may need to self-isolate and minimise their number. What happens if someone in school tests positive? "

However, these figures include only people who have died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus and other measures suggest the number of deaths is higher. Find out how the pandemic has affected your area and how it compares with the national average:  If you can't see the look-up click here. The government announced 18,950 confirmed cases on Monday.  After a steady decline since the first peak in April, confirmed cases started rising again in July, with the rate of growth increasing sharply in September and October.  Approximately one in 100 people in homes in England had coronavirus in the week ending 23 October, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.  While there are some differences between the nations, there are wider regional variations within England: the estimated prevalence in the North West is one in 43 people, while in the South East it is one in 220. Although hospital admissions for Covid-19 remain below the levels seen in the spring, there are big regional disparities.  With rising admissions, there have been warnings that hospitals will have to cut back core services.  Cases are rising quickly across large parts of England, with other spikes in areas of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The orange areas on the map below are those currently seeing the highest number of cases per 100,000 people. Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in recent weeks. In England, a new four-week lockdown will begin on Thursday - replacing the current three-tier system until 2 December. Scotland has moved to a five-tier system of virus alert levels from Monday.  Wales has already started a national lockdown while Northern Ireland has also introduced additional restrictions. Lockdown rules: Check the Covid-19 restrictions where you live The government announced 136 further deaths across the UK on Monday. Of those deaths, 126 were in England, seven in Northern Ireland and three in Wales. There were no deaths reported in Scotland, though most Register Offices in Scotland are closed at the weekend. Three times as many people have died from Covid-19 than from flu and pneumonia in England and Wales this year, according to official figures. Between January and August 2020, there were 48,168 deaths due to Covid-19 compared to 13,600 from pneumonia. Only 394 were due to flu. Rules were amended over the summer to include deaths in the coronavirus total only if they occurred within 28 days of a positive test. Previously in England, all deaths after a positive test were included. England has seen the majority of UK deaths from Covid-19. Using the 28-day cut-off, there have been more than 40,000.   Coronavirus in Scotland: Key figures and trendsWhat do the stats tell us in Wales? TESTING: What tests are available?JOBS: What is the job support scheme?SYMPTOMS: What are they and how to guard against them?GLOBAL TRACKER: Where are the virus hotspots?YOUR QUESTIONS: We answer your queries When looking at the overall death toll from coronavirus, official figures count deaths in three different ways. Government figures count people who tested positive for coronavirus and died within 28 days. But there are two other measures.  The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been almost 59,000 deaths by 16 October. The second method looks at all UK deaths over and above the number usually expected for the time of year - known as excess deaths. This measure shows the death toll was more than 66,500 by 16 October. There were 11,928 deaths registered in the UK in the week of 16 October, according to the latest figures reported by the Office for National Statistics. Some 761 of these deaths involved Covid-19 - up by 287, or 61%, on the previous week's number.  This represents 8% of the peak of 9,495 deaths recorded in a week, reached on 17 April.  The average number of deaths registered each week normally rises gradually at this time of year, by about 200 deaths a week, but the growth this week is faster than normal, up by 569 in a week. The ""R number"" is the average number of people an infected person will pass the disease on to.  If R is below one, then the number of people contracting the disease will fall; if it is above one, the number will grow.  On Friday, the government said its estimate for the R number across the whole of the UK was 1.1-1.3. The estimate for England is 1.1-1.3, while for Scotland it is 1-1.3. The estimate for Wales is 1-1.4 and in Northern Ireland it is 1.4. The government has said in the past that the R number is one of the most important factors in making policy decisions. "
55,Covid: Who can go back on to furlough?,"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 23:15:11 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52135342,,"Hours before the furlough scheme was due to end, the government announced it will be extended until December, as it brings in a further lockdown in England. The initiative, which has paid up to 80% of the wages of millions of people unable to work due to the effects of coronavirus pandemic, was due to be replaced by the less generous Job Support Scheme (JSS) on 1 November. Under the Coronavirus Jobs Retention Scheme, to give furlough its official title, employees placed on leave received 80% of their pay, up to a maximum of £2,500 a month.  Furlough was introduced back in March to prevent mass redundancies. The scheme subsidises the wages of people who can't do their jobs, either because their workplace is closed, or because there is no longer enough work for them. About 10 million jobs have been claimed for, with an estimated two million people still on furlough at the end of October.  The government had resisted repeated calls from unions, business groups and other political parties to extend the scheme. But as part of the announcement of month-long restrictions in England, including the closure of pubs, restaurants, gyms and non-essential shops, the government said the furlough scheme would be extended until December. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ''under no illusions'' as to how difficult the new lockdown would be for businesses that had already faced so much hardship this year. Employees won't notice any difference in their pay packet, but the scheme has become more generous for employers.  In recent months, firms have had to top up furloughed wages by 20%, with the government paying  60%. Now, the state will put in the full 80%, with the employer only covering pension and national insurance contributions. Since July, employers have been able to bring back employees part-time, and furlough them for the rest. This will continue. To be eligible for this extension, employees must have been on the payroll by 30 October 2020, but they don't need to have been furloughed before. While the government updates the system, employers will submit their wage claim to the government, and be refunded afterwards. After that, they will be paid upfront to cover the cost. The government will also give firms: Up to £3,000 per month under the Local Restrictions Support Grant if their premises is forced to close£1,000 for every furloughed employee kept on until at least the end of January£1,500 for every out-of-work 16-24 year-old given a ''high quality'' six-month work placement£2,000 for every under-25 apprentice taken on until the end of January, or £1,500 for over-25s A grant available to self-employed people affected by coronavirus has also been doubled to 40% of profits, with a maximum grant of £3,750  over a three-month period. Furlough will end in December, when England comes out of lockdown, the government says. Regions will then be classed into tiers as before, based on their coronavirus risk level, and the Job Support Scheme will kick in. Under that scheme, if a businesses has to close due to local restrictions, workers will be paid 67% of their wages - up to a maximum of £2,083.33 a month. Employers won't have to pay towards an employee's salary. Firms that can stay open, but only have enough work for employees to return part-time, will also be eligible for help. Staff will have to be paid by their employer to work a minimum 20% of their hours per month. The employer must pay an extra 4% of total wages to cover some of the hours not worked, and the government will pay 49% of the total salary to cover hours not worked. So, overall the employee would get at least 73% of salary. The maximum contribution the government will make is £1,541.75.

56,Covid: Why is coronavirus such a threat?,"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 22:58:54 GMT",https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-54648684,,"A simple virus has brought life as we know it to a screeching halt. We have faced viral threats before, including pandemics, yet the world does not shut down for every new infection or flu season.  So what is it about this coronavirus? What are the quirks of its biology that pose a unique threat to our bodies and our lives? In the early stages of an infection the virus is able to deceive the body.  Coronavirus can be running rampant in our lungs and airways and yet our immune system thinks everything is a-ok. ""This virus is brilliant, it allows you to have a viral factory in your nose and feel completely well,"" says Prof Paul Lehner from the University of Cambridge. Our body's cells start releasing chemicals - called interferons - once they are being hijacked by a virus and this is a warning signal to the rest of the body and the immune system.  But the coronavirus has an ""amazing capability"" of switching off this chemical warning, Prof Lehner says, ""it does it so well you don't even know you're ill"". He says when you look at infected cells in the laboratory you cannot tell they have been infected and yet tests show they are ""screaming with virus"" and this is just one of the ""joker cards"" the virus can play.  The amount of virus in our body begins to peak the day before we begin to get sick. But it takes at least a week before Covid progresses to the point where people need hospital treatment.  ""This is a really brilliant evolutionary tactic - you don't go to bed, you go out and have a good time,"" says Prof Lehner. So the virus is like a dangerous driver fleeing the scene - the virus has moved on to the next victim long before we either recover or die.  In stark terms, ""the virus doesn't care"" if you die, says Prof Lehner, ""this is a hit and run virus"". This is a massive contrast with the original Sars-coronavirus, back in 2002. It was most infectious days after people became ill, so they were easy to isolate. Remember the last pandemic? In 2009 there were huge fears about H1N1, aka swine flu.  However, it turned out to be no way near as deadly as anticipated because older people already had some protection. The new strain was similar enough to some that had been encountered in the past.  There are four other human coronaviruses, which cause common cold symptoms. Prof Tracy Hussell from the University of Manchester, said: ""This is a new one, so we don't think there's much prior immunity there."" The newness of Sars-CoV-2, to give it the official name, she says, can be ""quite a shock to your immune system"". This lack of prior-protection is comparable to when Europeans took smallpox with them to the New World, with deadly consequences. Building an immune defence from scratch is a real problem for older people, as their immune system is slow off the mark. Learning to fight a new infection involves a lot of trial and error from the immune system. But in older age we produce a less diverse pool of T-cells - a core component of the immune system - so it is harder to find ones that can defend against Coronavirus.  Covid starts off as a lung disease (even there it does strange and unusual things) and can affect the whole body.  Prof Mauro Giacca, from King's College London, says many aspects of Covid are ""unique"" to the disease, indeed ""it is different from any other common viral disease"". He says the virus does more than simply kill lung cells, it corrupts them too. Cells have been seen fusing together into massive and malfunctioning cells - called syncytia - that seem to stick around. And Prof Giacca says you can have ""complete regeneration"" of the lungs after severe flu, but ""this does not happen"" with Covid.  ""It is quite a peculiar infection,"" he said.  Blood clotting also goes strangely awry in Covid, with stories of doctors unable to get a line into a patient because it is immediately blocked with clotted blood. Clotting chemicals in the blood are ""200%, 300%, 400% higher"" than normal in some Covid patients, says Prof Beverly Hunt from King's College London. She told Inside Health: ""Quite honestly, in a very long career, I've never seen any group of patients with such sticky blood.""  These whole-body effects could be due to the cellular doorway the virus strolls through to infect our cells - called the ACE2 receptor. It is found throughout the body including in blood vessels, the liver and kidneys, as well as the lungs. The virus can cause runaway inflammation in some patients, making the immune system go into overdrive, with damaging consequences for the rest of the body.  Covid is worse if you are obese, as a generous waistline increases the risk of needing intensive care, or death. This is unusual.  ""Its very strong association with obesity is something we haven't seen with other viral infections. With other lung injuries, obese people often do better rather than worse,"" said Prof Sir Stephen O'Rahilly, from the University of Cambridge.  ""It looks pretty specific [to Covid] it probably happens in pandemic flu, but not regular flu."" Fat deposited throughout the body, in organs like the liver, causes a metabolic disturbance which seems to combine badly with coronavirus.  Obese patients are more likely to have higher levels of inflammation in the body and proteins that can lead to clotting.  Follow James on Twitter "
