0,"A Golden Team, a Terrible Title and a Show That Vanished","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:08:17 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/theater/a-pray-by-blecht-sondheim-bernstein.html,Jesse Green,"How do you top “West Side Story”? If you’re Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins, the answer is: You don’t. Well, you try. Ten years after the composer, the lyricist and the director-choreographer of that show (along with its book writer, Arthur Laurents) changed the musical theater with their contemporary take on “Romeo and Juliet,” they rejoined forces to develop another project. The idea was Robbins’s. He thought that one of Bertolt Brecht’s Lehrstücke, or teaching plays, could make a good musical, being short and pointed and fable-like. In 1967, he asked Sondheim to read “The Measures Taken,” the first in a collection of four translations, for possible adaptation. When Sondheim balked, finding the material too inert, Robbins told him to read the next play in the book. That one, “The Exception and the Rule,” is about a rapacious oil merchant (read: capitalism) who races another merchant across a desert to win a lucrative deal. Accompanying him are a guide and a porter; when the three get lost, and the porter (read: exploited labor) tries to help the merchant, the merchant misunderstands the gesture and shoots him. Naturally, being of the ruling class, he is acquitted: Self-defense, the judge decides, applies even if the threat is imaginary. Sondheim, eager to work with Robbins, whom he called “the only genius I had ever associated with,” thought this story might work, even though he found most of Brecht, and especially the teaching plays, “insufferably simplistic.” In his book “Look, I Made a Hat,” he wrote that there was “too much Lehr in each stück” — too much teaching in each play — “to hold my attention.” Indeed, his attention waned after “taking a stab” at two songs. Giving up, he suggested that Robbins get Bernstein to write both music and lyrics. But Robbins instead asked Jerry Leiber, the word half of the pop songwriting team of Leiber and Stoller, to work with the maestro. Though the odd couple did complete some numbers, the show stalled out. Most do, usually for their own good. But “The Exception and the Rule,” as it was then called, had a gleam of possibility that kept it from dying completely. Perhaps it would be an exception itself, as “West Side Story,” which almost fell through several times, was in its day. What looked like the key arrived when the playwright John Guare, then known for surreal way-off-Broadway comedies, joined up with a great idea for the adaptation. The story would now take place in a television studio where the Brecht play is being readied for broadcast. The tension between the star actor playing the merchant (who was to be white) and the supporting actors playing the guide and porter (who were to be Black) would parallel the class paranoia of the inner scenes, while adding an element of racial paranoia to the mix. Sondheim, noting that the Brecht would be chopped up by scenes set in the present, “and thus not be so relentlessly Brechtian,” rejoined the team. By April 1968, a New York Times theater column trumpeted a January 1969 opening for the new musical. Later that year, the producers announced that the Broadway star Zero Mostel would play the lead. It seemed a mere glitch in its inevitable success when, in October, the show, budgeted at $600,000 and now bearing Bernstein’s awful Spooneristic title “A Pray by Blecht,” was postponed until the following fall. And then: nothing. It was so dead that Bernstein, nine years later, describing it as “a big wonderful show that could have been,” got its title wrong. He called it “The Measures Taken.” What happened? According to “Look, I Made a Hat,” in which Sondheim relates “almost all” of the tale, the golden collaboration was “no fun at all”; he stepped away again after he and Bernstein, who treated him as if he were “still an apprentice” from “West Side Story” days, wrote eight songs. Robbins quit soon thereafter: In the middle of auditions, he excused himself to Guare and Bernstein, left the theater and took off in a cab to Kennedy Airport. Perhaps it is better that some shows should die so that others might live. After “A Pray by Blecht” collapsed, Sondheim went on almost immediately to write “Company,” “Follies” and “A Little Night Music.” Guare’s 1971 play “The House of Blue Leaves” jump-started his career. Bernstein and Robbins would each return to Broadway, albeit with mixed success, while continuing to excel in classical music and ballet. Yet it was Robbins, the runaway, who couldn’t let the idea die. In the spring of 1987, at Lincoln Center Theater, he directed a multiweek workshop of a new version of the show called “The Race to Urga.” Sondheim attended only two rehearsals, which (he recalled in an email) were inchoate and disorganized. “I couldn’t tell anything about it,” he wrote, “except that it seemed (as I’d always thought it was) self-consciously Important instead of spontaneous and exuberant, which is the chief saving grace of any Brecht play (and was Brecht’s intention).” Guare, who provided the necessary new lyrics, recently declined to comment on the experience, having “closed the door” on it ages ago. One person was happy to comment, though: Zero Mostel’s son Josh. In the 1987 workshop, he was cast (after Kevin Kline apparently withdrew) in the role originally intended for his father. By the time the show was performed for invited audiences in May of that year, he recalled, Robbins had given up on the white vs. Black theme; Joe Grifasi played the guide and Thomas Ikeda the porter, still unfortunately referred to as the “coolie.” But Brecht’s warning about the dangers of unlimited power remained — and not just in the coda, during which planted actors rose from the audience to sing about revolution. Robbins himself was a warning about unlimited power. “Working with Jerry was torture,” Mostel said. “Thomas Ikeda literally passed out in my arms in rehearsal, from exhaustion. At our last show, Bernstein fell down the stairs trying to get out of there. Jerry was nasty even to Guare, a very sweet guy. He was so controlling and paranoid he wouldn’t tell us what time the performances were until right before they started. “But I have to say the songs were brilliant. And the book was one of the best of any musical I’d been in. Some friends brought a 6-year-old to the show, and he said, ‘Is that all?’ — which is a pretty good review. It should have moved forward, and the reason it didn’t is that no one could stand Jerry.” That’s a shame; a musical exploring the prerogatives of class (and the power imbalances inherent in the theater) would be exceedingly timely now. At one point, Sondheim has a police officer sing proudly of his beat, “Thirty natives and all so quiet,” to which his partner replies, “Thirty-seven before the riot.” That’s a lyric that needs no alteration to work as satire, or tragedy — or at any rate a stageworthy bit of Lehr — in 2020. Next in Unopened: The Bob Dylan musical that tried to find a way — way before “Girl From the North Country.”  "
1,Johnny Depp Loses Court Case Against Newspaper That Called Him a ‘Wife Beater’,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 17:01:15 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/johnny-depp-libel-case.html,Alex Marshall,"LONDON — Johnny Depp on Monday lost his court case against a British newspaper that called him a “wife beater” and claimed there was “overwhelming evidence” that he had assaulted the actress Amber Heard repeatedly during their marriage. Mr. Depp’s assaults included head-butting Ms. Heard, repeatedly hitting her and tearing out clumps of her hair, wrote Andrew Nicol, the British judge who heard the case, in a ruling issued online on Monday. In dismissing the case, he said the defendants had shown that what they published was “substantially true.” The assaults “must have been terrifying,” the judge wrote regarding incidents in March 2015 in Australia, in which Ms. Heard said that Mr. Depp assaulted her several times, including smashing a telephone beside her face. “I accept that Mr. Depp put her in fear of her life,” the judge wrote. The judge also acknowledged the risk Ms. Heard had taken in speaking up about the violence. “I also accept that Ms. Heard’s allegations have had a negative effect on her career as an actor and activist,” he said. Women’s rights groups in Britain praised the decision. “This is an important ruling and one which we hope sends a very powerful message: Every single survivor of domestic abuse should be listened to and should be heard,” Lisa King, a spokeswoman for Refuge, a British charity for survivors of domestic violence, said in a statement. When the case was heard in July, it often seemed as if it were occurring solely to generate lurid newspaper headlines and movie-world gossip. Countless unsavory details of Mr. Depp and Ms. Heard’s marriage were aired. But it was actually a libel case in which Mr. Depp, 57, was suing News Group Newspapers, the publishers of The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper, and Dan Wootton, that newspaper’s executive editor, over a 2018 article that said there was “overwhelming evidence” that Mr. Depp had assaulted Ms. Heard. The article called Mr. Depp a “wife beater” and urged the author J.K. Rowling to intervene and have Mr. Depp removed from the “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them” movie series, based on her book. The newspaper’s legal team argued that the accusations in the article were “accurate and true.” Ms. Heard, 34, testified on the newspaper’s behalf and said in pretrial documents that Mr. Depp had assaulted her on 14 occasions during their relationship starting before they were married. Mr. Depp denied all of the claims, but the judge found that most of them did occur, citing a range of text messages from Mr. Depp among the evidence. Mr. Depp is also suing Ms. Heard for defamation in the United States over an opinion article that she wrote for The Washington Post under the headline “I spoke up against sexual violence — and faced our culture’s wrath. That has to change.” Mr. Depp says the article led to his being dropped from the “Pirates of the Caribbean” movie franchise. It was not immediately clear whether the British judge’s ruling would have any implications for that case. Jenny Afia, a partner at Schillings, the British law firm that represented Depp, said in an emailed statement that the American proceedings were “ongoing.” She called the British decision “as perverse as it is bewildering” and said that “it would be ridiculous for Mr. Depp not to appeal.” The pair met in 2011 while making “The Rum Diary,” a movie based on the book by Hunter S. Thompson, and married in February 2015. Ms. Heard filed for divorce just over a year later. She also obtained a temporary restraining order against the actor after accusing him of hitting her. Ms. Heard later withdrew the claim, and in January 2017 the pair agreed to a $7 million divorce settlement. “There was never any intent of physical or emotional harm,” they said in a statement at the time. During the case, Ms. Heard said that the first time Mr. Depp assaulted her was in 2013, before their marriage. On that occasion, she said, he hit her three times after a discussion about one of his tattoos. The tattoo originally read “Winona forever,” in reference to Winona Ryder, Mr. Depp’s former partner, but he had it changed to read “Wino forever.” “It felt like my eye popped out,” Ms. Heard said of the third strike, saying that it knocked her off balance and to the floor. Sasha Wass, a lawyer representing the newspaper, told the court in her closing argument that Mr. Depp’s violence had come about because of a dislike of Ms. Heard’s independence, as well as his alcohol and drug use. Ms. Wass said that Mr. Depp had used so many substances that “he may not even have been aware of the extent of his violence and terrifying behavior.” The judge agreed with most of that characterization, repeatedly highlighting Mr. Depp’s jealousy at potential love rivals and his drug use that impaired his memory. During the hearings, Mr. Depp’s team claimed that Ms. Heard was actually the abuser, provoking arguments and, in one case in an argument in Australia, throwing a vodka bottle at him, severing his fingertip. Ms. Heard testified that Mr. Depp had severed his own fingertip in the argument while smashing a phone next to her head. In his ruling, the judge devoted 17 pages to that fight. He noted that Mr. Depp had admitted that after sustaining the injury, he painted graffiti with his own blood on the walls of a house the couple was renting. “It is a sign of the depth of his rage,” the judge wrote. “What exactly caused the injury is uncertain,” he said, but added, “it may well be that Mr. Depp accidentally cut his finger on a piece of broken glass.” Mr. Depp’s team also portrayed the accusations as a hoax that Ms. Heard had constructed as an insurance policy in case the marriage broke down. “She was, according to this scenario, nothing more than a gold-digger,” Justice Nicol wrote in his ruling. “I do not accept this characterization of Ms. Heard,” he added, pointing out she had given her $7 million divorce settlement to charity. “Her donation is hardly the act one would expect of a gold-digger,” the judge said. Harriet Wistrich, the director of the Center for Women’s Justice, a British organization, said in an email that she was “very relieved that the judge has rejected some of the common tropes used to undermine victims of domestic violence, such as ‘She was motivated to stay with him for the money’ or ‘If he was violent, why didn’t she leave?’” “We hope the outcome of this case will serve as a warning to wealthy men who seek to use the courts to silence women who speak out about abuse,” Ms. Wistrich added. Ms. Heard acknowledged having once hit Mr. Depp, but told the court that she had been trying to protect her sister, whom she thought the actor was about to push down some stairs. “I will never forget it, because it was the first time after all these years that I actually struck him back,” Ms. Heard said. After the ruling was issued on Monday, The Sun said in a statement, “Domestic abuse victims must never be silenced, and we thank the judge for his careful consideration and thank Amber Heard for her courage in giving evidence to the court.” Jennifer Robinson, a lawyer for Ms. Heard, said the actress was “unable to comment on the case due to the ongoing U.S. proceedings.” But Elaine Charlson Bredehoft, Ms. Heard’s American lawyer, said in a statement that the judgment was “not a surprise.” “We are committed to obtaining justice for Amber Heard in the U.S. Court and defending Ms. Heard’s right to free speech,” Ms. Bredehoft said. "
2,"With New Show, Tschabalala Self Explores Black American Identity","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:31:41 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/design/tschabalala-self-black-identity.html,Robin Pogrebin,"NEW HAVEN — It was warm for October, the sun flooding Tschabalala Self’s paint-splattered studio here, and the last piece left to finish for her first major gallery exhibition in New York City was giving the artist “a lot of trouble.” The painting — featuring a woman with exaggerated proportions who is shooting a gun in hot shorts, a Western hat and cowboy boots — wasn’t legible to Ms. Self in the way she needed it to be. Its formal qualities were not quite lining up with the overarching themes of her project, which include identity, mythology and pop culture. But Ms. Self seemed unconcerned about getting it done. Nor did she seem preoccupied by the Black Lives Matter movement churning in the country; she has been dealing with issues of race in her work all along. That consciousness is on full display in the eight canvases on view, starting Nov. 6, at Galerie Eva Presenhuber in Lower Manhattan. The exhibition, “Cotton Mouth,” through Dec. 19, explores Black American life in contemporary culture and history. The colorful works display Ms. Self’s signature combination of painting and collage. She does not use glue or adhesive; in homage to her mother’s facility as a seamstress as well as the quilting tradition, Ms. Self integrates swatches of fabric into her paintings by deploying the sewing machine as well as the paintbrush: She draws with stitches. (She also works in sculpture.) “The methods she uses were always relegated to outsider artists, especially women,” the Miami collector Mera Rubell said. The figures in Ms. Self’s work, she added, “are fictional characters, but we know them. We know them to be strong, we know them to have honor, we know them to win against all odds, we know them to be people we admire because they carry big loads. She’s giving us new heroes.” The “heroes” in Ms. Self’s work are everyday people — composite characters informed by those the artist has encountered or observed on the streets of her native Harlem or elsewhere, like the kinetic young woman in her painting “Fast Girl,” or the beefy man with his back to us in a basketball jersey that reads “Sprewell.” Yet underlying their accessibility and whimsy are weighty concepts — personal narrative and the African diaspora. The “Sprewell” painting, for example, refers to the N.B.A. star Latrell Sprewell, who was suspended in 1997 for choking his Golden State Warriors coach in what the writer Camille Okhio describes in press materials for Ms. Self’s show as “a pointed demand for agency and poignant expression of fury and resilience.” These paintings speak to what Ms. Self said is the show’s main theme: “understanding and naming the institution of American slavery as the origin of Black American identity.” “For me, it’s clarifying what I mean when I refer to Blackness,” she added. “Without the institution of slavery, this country could never have been built to be what it is today. The Black American is almost a mascot for modernism. The Black American represents the modern world, the new world.” The title of the exhibition alludes not only to picking cotton but also to “cotton mouth,” when the body doesn’t produce enough saliva. “It references a tragic history for Black Americans and is a metaphor for the continued silencing of Black Americans,” said Ms. Presenhuber, who began representing Ms. Self in 2019. “Her work has always spoken for itself,” Ms. Presenhuber added, “but in the current sociopolitical climate, resonates even more.” While conversations these days about equity have informed the work in Ms. Self’s new show, she said, “I can’t say that I personally have come to any new realizations about race this past year.” At the same time, she acknowledged that present events bring an urgency and timeliness to her exhibition. “I feel excited to some degree about being able to show my work in this context,” Ms. Self said. “Now everyone is looking at it from the same vantage point.” Just five years out of art school and 30 years old, the artist is already a rising star. A solo exhibition, “By My Self,” is scheduled to open at the Baltimore Museum of Art in 2021, coming off her show at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, “Tschabalala Self: Out of Body,” which closed in September. Her work has been collected by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Philadelphia Museum and the Studio Museum in Harlem, where Ms. Self completed a residency last year. In its multiyear partnership with the Museum of Modern Art, the Studio Museum featured Ms. Self’s work at MoMA PS1 last fall during its annual Artist-in-Residence exhibition, “MOOD,” along with that of Allison Janae Hamilton and Sable Elyse Smith. And Ms. Self’s paintings have made their way into the highly charged contemporary art market, which is finally beginning to value the work of Black artists. In just the last year, 26 Self pieces have come up for auction, according to Artnet, with one — the flamboyant, hypercolored “Princess,” reaching a high price for the artist of $568,000 at Phillips in London last February. Ms. Self even got a splashy spread in Vogue last spring. Taking a break from work to talk the other day, dressed in a sweatshirt and Converse sneakers, Ms. Self — whose first name is pronounced SHA-ba-la-la, though she often goes by Tschaba — said she would just as soon never see her work at auction because artists do not directly benefit from such secondary sales. (Her work sells for $35,000 to $240,000 when sold directly through galleries.) She also finds the auction format uncomfortably reminiscent of the institution of slavery. “It’s annoying, given the subject matter, for the works to be traded and sold in that way,” she said. “The whole spectacle of it is to me very disheartening. I don’t like to be involved in situations where my name is at stake and I don’t have control over it.” Ms. Self said she stays focused on the larger goal: reaching people through art “that is immediately relevant and interesting.” “I want my work to connect to that larger audience,” she explained. “I like for it to be rooted in everyday life. I like to have the work be as powerful as it can be.” That mix of the quotidian and the unusual is at play on her canvases, which the New York Times critic Roberta Smith in 2016 described as having “a marvelous random intricacy.” The scenes are domestic, personal — drawn from Ms. Self’s own experience. Her characters even wear her clothes — the young man in “Sprewell” is dressed in a pair of jeans she outgrew. For the fifth iteration of her “Bodega Run” series, Ms. Self transformed the lobby exhibition space of the Hammer in Los Angeles into one of New York City’s ubiquitous convenience stores, including wallpaper made from her line drawings of common foods, a tiled linoleum floor and paintings of customers. “Tschaba looks at questions of what representation can be,” said Legacy Russell, the associate curator of exhibitions at the Studio Museum, “and breaks those things open.” Having an exhibition in New York now is “a homecoming.” It is where Ms. Self went to high school (Nightingale-Bamford) before attending Bard College and earning her M.F.A. from Yale in 2015. It is where she still shares her family’s Hamilton Heights brownstone with four older siblings. Despite a New Haven apartment, a weekend place in Hudson, N.Y., and extended family in New Orleans, where her parents came from, New York City is home. Though her work has been shown at other galleries, like Thierry Goldberg in New York and Pilar Corrias in London, the exhibition at Eva Presenhuber is the most ambitious. For the first time she is including an audio component, a mash-up of her own monologue and other voices whose views she said she may not necessarily agree with. “Black pop culture is the oral history of the contemporary Black mythology,” Ms. Self says in her narration for the audio, in a stream of consciousness. “Within Black pop culture all ideas — contemporary, fiction and fact — become collapsed into one cohesive, one ever-evolving inconsistent but consistent narrative around Blackness.” Although the bulbous derrières and angular silhouettes of Ms. Self’s paintings have a comedic quality, the artist says that she is experimenting with humor in the audio segment, having been inspired in part by the satirical artist Robert Colescott. “By using the lens of humor, he was able to have more pointed conversations that maybe seep into one’s mind,” she said. She counts as other influences artists like Romare Bearden, Faith Ringgold, Jacob Lawrence and Howardena Pindell. Curators discuss her work in the context of Wangechi Mutu, Mickalene Thomas and Henry Taylor. “I see her very much in a cohort of her generation of artists who are integrating many different materials and opening new paths into thinking about Black life,” said Ruth Erickson, a curator at the ICA Boston, who worked with Ms. Self on her show there. Ms. Erickson — who drew connections between Ms. Self and Kevin Beasley, who also uses textiles, or Devan Shimoyama, who works in portraiture — added that the intelligence and material approach put her work “at the forefront of figurative and identity exploration.” That approach is evident throughout Ms. Self’s studio in an industrial building here, where scraps of colored, patterned fabric hang in a tangle from the ceiling (which leaks). Image ideas are pinned to the wall. Phrases are scribbled on a chalkboard (“social animal,” “made of wood”). Here, too, is the Black Barbie she bought at Walmart, having been captivated by the doll’s pronounced Afro. The artist works on the floor, wearing kneepads so that she can maneuver around her large paintings. She talks about the characters in her canvases as people she is getting to know, even as she is the one creating them. And while occasionally Ms. Self gets stuck in the process — as she did with the show’s final female figure, whose Western gear refers to a story about her family’s patriarch traveling from Texas on a horse to Louisiana — the artist brings an obvious confidence to her work, the knowledge that she’s found her way through in the past and will again, maybe differently this time. “You want to do something that’s innovative,” Ms. Self said. “You don’t want to parrot what you’ve done before.” "
3,Dancing on Grass and Concrete at New York City Ballet,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:38:35 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/dance/new-works-festival-new-york-city-ballet.html,Gia Kourlas,"When it comes to digital site-specific work, there’s a thin line between a dance on film and a perfume ad. It’s dispiriting to say that in New York City Ballet’s New Works Festival we get plenty of eau de ballet. That the company could present new work at all during a pandemic, as it did last week, with five short films that use the Lincoln Center campus as a set, is admirable. (Recently City Ballet called off its winter and spring seasons.) But there’s only so much whipping hair and water splashing, grassy knolls and dreamy overhead shots I can take. The company did branch out of its usual bubble, commissioning choreography by Sidra Bell, Andrea Miller and Jamar Roberts, who were working with the dancers for the first time; as well as by Pam Tanowitz and Justin Peck, City Ballet’s resident choreographer and artistic adviser. But what takes center stage more than the choreography is the filmmaking. Camerawork, both frantic and labored, gets in the way of dancing, creating a slickness — and a sameness — that turns stale fast. All but one of these short films was directed by Ezra Hurwitz (with cinematography by Jon Chema). Mr. Peck, with Jody Lee Lipes, as director of photography, took charge of his own. Just as choreography needs a point of view, a site needs a purpose. One work, “Solo for Russell: Sites 1-5,” seems to have a reason for using Lincoln Center as its stage. Choreographed by Ms. Tanowitz with Russell Janzen — a rare instance of credit given to a dancer in the ballet world — the piece features the unflappable Mr. Janzen walking with purpose from one location to the next, sometimes with a roll of Marley flooring tucked under his arm, sometimes changing in and out of costumes (by Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung). In one iteration, strips of pale blue and yellow drape from Mr. Janzen’s collarbone to one leg. He is already statuesque, but as he stands on the stage of the Damrosch Park bandshell, the sculptural effect of the draping fabric and the towering structure transforms him into a monument from another time. (Is that what a dancer has become in the age of the coronavirus?) Stoic and resolute, he has a last-man-on-earth quality. The clipped shots of movement — a slow promenade with a leg held forward in a pistol squat, a quick turn with a raised arm — are enhanced by Alfred Schnittke’s eerie music to convey a sense of resignation and alienation. Instead of showing us a complete dance, Ms. Tanowitz presents something more intriguing and, given our emotional mood, relatable: the shards of one. Ms. Bell’s “pixelation in a wave (Within Wires),” set to an original score by her jazz musician father, Dennis Bell, features a cast — Ghaleb Kayali, Mira Nadon, Emily Kikta and Peter Walker — bouncing between landscape shots, which render them bite-size, and close-ups that tend toward the precious. Working with the dancers’ lines and shapes as they intersect with and are juxtaposed against the architecture of the site — at one point, a raised lawn above a concrete pathway — Ms. Bell’s chiseled shapes feel random with all the quick cuts; instead of the cool tension she seems to be going for, it’s hectic. Ms. Miller’s “new song,” set to music by the Chilean singer Víctor Jara, has more flow as Harrison Coll, Indiana Woodward, Unity Phelan and Sebastian Villarini-Velez sail from the plaza to the wooded grove and into the water of the wading pool in the center of Hearst Plaza. Usually, Ms. Miller’s work seems linked to Ohad Naharin, the Israeli choreographer for whom she previously danced; this time, it is Pina Bausch. Hair. Long dresses. Got it. The emotion of it, though, cracks something open in Ms. Phelan, who is unleashed in a way she hasn’t been before. But it’s all too earnest: As a group, the dancers walk into the water where, after the camera swoops overhead, they splash their chests with feeling. The pool is a tempting location, and Mr. Roberts uses it, too, in his “Water Rite.” Most impressive here is the soloist, Victor Abreu, a member of the corps de ballet, who has always struck me as having a certain vulnerability: the look of a boy trapped in a man’s body. In “Rite,” set to jazz music by Ambrose Akinmusire, Mr. Abreu reveals a newfound maturity and power. And Mr. Roberts offers an arresting final image: The musicians, joining Mr. Abreu in the water, play the final note. But in both this film and Ms. Miller’s, the use of the pool feels obvious and facile; I kept thinking of Eiko and Koma, the Japanese dance artists — and masters of site-specific work — who, in 2011, performed here, using the reflecting pool as a way, in part, to explore the sensation of surrender. Mr. Peck succumbs to something else in “Thank You, New York”: sentimentality. The opening features images of the city alongside video portraits of the cast — Georgina Pazcoguin, Christopher Grant, Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley — expressing their love for it in voice-overs. “New York, especially, now is a phoenix just waiting to rise from the ashes,” Ms. Pazcoguin says. “I know it. I can feel it. I can feel the embers, I can feel the energy.” They do gas on, staring into the camera with lingering gazes or off into the distance. Woven throughout are images of the skyline, the Statue of Liberty, a street of outdoor diners. And then it gets worse. The music starts: a reworked version of the song “Thank You, New York” by Chris Thile. In different locations, the dancers let loose: Mr. Stanley, at Riverside Park, sways this way and that while pausing to raise his eyes and arms to the treacly lyrics “Reaching up for stars that we’ll never see.” To the sound of “Mmmm,” he bends his knees and gives a little swivel. Mr. Grant glides across the handball courts at Brooklyn Bridge Park with fervent footwork while Ms. Pazcoguin, atop the company’s theater at Lincoln Center, dashes to a corner of the roof and stares at the Metropolitan Opera: so near and yet so far. In terms of their expansive, passionate dancing, the women definitely have an edge: Both Ms. Pazcoguin and Ms. Mearns, who is bathed in darkness while flittering across the pavement of a Chinatown street, never hold back. It’s true on film, too. But this film is not a keeper for the pandemic time capsule. It is yet another sneaker ballet from Mr. Peck in the manner of Jerome Robbins, though without his subtle hand. Midway, it shifts into an unintentional comedy as the lyrics press on: “Thank you, New York, may I have another/Dance with you upon the winds of change.” The music creates some earworm trauma. (And for whatever reason, I can’t get Taylor Swift’s “Welcome to New York” out of my head, either.) But while the sentiments behind Mr. Peck’s film are clear — we miss New York, and we miss dance — this love letter doesn’t deliver. "
4,"Dementia ‘Took Its Toll’ on Sean Connery, Wife Says","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:52:18 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/movies/sean-connery-dead-dementia.html,Sarah Bahr,"Sean Connery, the actor who originated the role of James Bond, had dementia in the last few months of his life, his wife, Micheline Roquebrune, told The Daily Mail. Mr. Connery died this weekend at age 90 in the Bahamas. Ms. Roquebrune, who was married to Mr. Connery for 45 years, said the actor “was not able to express himself” in the months leading up to his death. “It was no life for him,” she said. “At least he died in his sleep and it was just so peaceful.” Mr. Connery played the role of the beloved British secret agent in “Dr. No” (1962), “From Russia With Love” (1963), “Goldfinger” (1964), “Thunderball” (1965), “You Only Live Twice” (1967), “Diamonds Are Forever” (1971) and “Never Say Never Again” (1983). Ms. Roquebrune, a Moroccan-French painter, married Mr. Connery in 1975. She told The Mail he was a “model of a man” and that life would “be very hard without him.” “He had dementia, and it took its toll on him,” Ms. Roquebrune said. But, she added, “He got his final wish to slip away without any fuss.” Dementia, which is a group of conditions characterized by memory loss and impaired judgment, is most commonly caused by Alzheimer’s disease. Although it affects mainly older people, it is not a normal part of aging. About 50 million people have dementia, with approximately 10 million additional people developing the condition each year, according to the World Health Organization. The early stages often include forgetfulness and becoming disoriented in familiar places, which may progress to becoming lost at home, behavior changes and needing help with personal care. In the final stages of the disease, a person may have difficulty walking and recognizing family and friends. After Mr. Connery’s death, a number of Bond actors past and present paid tribute to the titan of the silver screen. Daniel Craig, who has played James Bond since 2006, said in a statement on the 007 website on Saturday that Mr. Connery had wit and charm that “could be measured in megawatts” and that he had “helped create the modern blockbuster.” “He will continue to influence actors and filmmakers alike for years to come,” Mr. Craig said. “My thoughts are with his family and loved ones.” George Lazenby, who played James Bond in “Her Majesty’s Secret Service” (1969), wrote on Instagram on Mr. Connery’s 90th birthday in August that the actor was not just “the all-time greatest 007,” but, he added in an Instagram post on Saturday, “a man after my own heart.” “A great actor, a great man and underappreciated artist has left us,” Mr. Lazenby wrote.

5,"‘Jeopardy!’ Greats Who Battled for Top Title Get New Show, 'The Chase'","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:47:11 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/television/jeopardy-the-chase.html,Julia Jacobs,"Just when television executives seemed to have exhausted all options for getting the three most famous “Jeopardy!” contestants back on television, they managed to find another way. This time, it’s through a different quiz show entirely, one that doesn’t make its contestants turn their answers into questions. The three “Jeopardy!” stars who in January battled for the title of “Greatest of All Time” — Ken Jennings, James Holzhauer and Brad Rutter — will take turns appearing on an ABC revival of “The Chase,” a new version of a quiz show that airs in Britain, the network announced on Monday. An earlier American version of the quiz show aired on Game Show Network from 2013 to 2015, on which Holzhauer faced off as a contestant against Mark Labbett — known as “the beast” — in 2014. He performed so well that he was asked to audition to be a colleague of Labbett’s, The Atlantic reported last year. (He auditioned but was not asked to be on the show, Holzhauer said in an email.) The new show, which does not yet have a premiere date, will be hosted by Sara Haines, a co-host of ABC’s “The View.” “The Chase” pits three competitors against a trivia powerhouse known as the Chaser — a role that will be filled by Jennings, Holzhauer and Rutter on a rotating basis. The Chaser is tasked with getting in the contestants’ way as they try to make money while answering up to 166 quiz questions during an hourlong episode. During one portion of the game, contestants and the Chaser are asked the same multiple-choice questions, racing toward the end of a giant game board with each correct answer. The Chaser, who starts a few positions behind, aims to catch up to the contestants, serving as a sort of know-it-all antagonist (a role all three men should be used to playing). The new show is aimed to build on the ratings success ABC enjoyed earlier this year when the three men battled it out for the ultimate “Jeopardy!” title. Jennings, who had captivated “Jeopardy!” fans with a 74-game winning streak in 2004, came out on top, adding $1 million to the $3.4 million that he had already made on the show. Jennings is now a consulting producer on “Jeopardy!,” which started its 37th season in September. Holzhauer’s astounding 32-game streak in 2019, during which he became known for betting big and winning eye-popping single-game amounts, is what set the stage for a face-off among him, Jennings and Rutter. Rutter was on the show when contestants weren’t permitted to win more than five consecutive games, preventing him from winning more during the regular season. But he has won more money on the show than Jennings if you include all of the winnings he amassed during special tournaments. (Rutter did not win a match during the “G.O.A.T.” tournament, and Holzhauer often rubbed it in with snarky comments about his performance on social media.) Still, the contestants celebrated the new deal on Monday, with Jennings tweeting, “The boys are back,” and Holzhauer joking about the dearth of new movies to catch up on from the slow pandemic months. The first three episodes of the “Greatest of All Time” tournament raked in an average of 14.9 million viewers each, according to Nielsen data. The tournament aired for a second time in May. "
6,"City Pages, the Alt-Weekly Where Music Writing Reigned Supreme","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:29:13 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/music/minneapolis-city-pages-music.html,Keith Harris,"When a young music journalist moved to New York in 2006 looking for work, she didn’t quite grasp the power of her résumé. Noticing that her most recent job was as music editor for the Minneapolis alternative weekly City Pages, the editor interviewing Lindsey Thomas for a position at MTV News playfully dropped a phrase she’d never heard: “So you’re part of the Minnesota music critic mafia, huh?” She got the gig. Since the days when Prince vaulted to stardom and the Replacements and Hüsker Dü established the gold standard for raw indie-rock, Minneapolis has always punched above its weight, musically. And City Pages, the free weekly that documented those artists, developed an outsized reputation all its own. While it outlasted many of its kin, including the Village Voice, City Pages was shut down suddenly last Wednesday by its current owner, the Minneapolis daily newspaper the Star Tribune, which said challenges brought by the pandemic made the paper “economically unviable.” Throughout its four-decade run, a disproportionate number of City Pages alumni went on to work at national musical magazines, to publish definitive books of music history and criticism, and to foster a tone that was envied and emulated throughout the industry. Even City Pages’ readership proved influential. “It was absolutely essential as a local road map to arts culture,” said Ryan Schreiber, the founder of the music website Pitchfork, who grew up in the Twin Cities suburbs. “City Pages led me to weird places where I made weird friends, and it taught us about all the weird art that brought us together. Its 2006 cover story on Pitchfork is the only press that’s ever meant enough to me to have framed.” Before the web made every publication instantaneously available to every reader, a newspaper assumed its audience was primarily local. But media on the coasts kept tabs on City Pages — especially its music section. The rock criticism pioneer Greil Marcus, who published his “Real Life Top 10” column in City Pages from 2003 to 2004, once called it “the best alternative weekly in America.” Talented writers from out of town sought to contribute (a young Ta-Nehisi Coates unenthusiastically reviewed Ghostface Killah’s “Supreme Clientele” in 2000) and even moved across the country to work there. (I relocated to Minneapolis in the late ’90s and was the music editor from 2000 to 2001 and again from 2017 until they shut off the lights.) “Reading City Pages was the first time I realized music criticism didn’t have to be about, ‘Is this album good or bad?’” said the writer Melissa Maerz, who worked there in the early ’00s and later was a staffer at Spin and Rolling Stone. “The writing could be kind of experimental, almost novelistic, and it could be funny or high-concept.” The City Pages story began in 1979, a decade after the births of the music magazines Rolling Stone and Creem, when the publisher Tom Bartel started a music paper called Sweet Potato that was written almost exclusively (and often pseudonymously) by the editor Martin Keller. Rechristened as City Pages, the publication added arts and news coverage, but its main draw remained its music reporting and criticism, including some of the earliest published stories on the Replacements and Hüsker Dü — and, of course, Prince, who Keller once offhandedly referred to as “His Royal Badness” in a column, an epithet he was shocked to hear the VJ Mark Goodman use on MTV a short while later. City Pages’ local connections gave it an unexpected leg up on its competitors. After Keller wrote a piece about the childhood Bob Dylan friend Larry Kegan in 1983, the grateful Minnesota-born rock legend reportedly asked Kegan, “What’s a nice thing we could do for Marty?” The answer: a long interview. A music critic, Steve Perry, took over as editor in chief in the late ’80s. “All I ever wanted to do was surround myself with smart, interesting people,” he said. To handle music and arts coverage, Perry brought in Jim Walsh and Terri Sutton, two writers whose styles focused on their personal reactions to the music they heard, and he gave them free rein. “We were let loose to follow whatever passion we wanted to follow,” Sutton said, though Bartel had one request: “He asked if I could just swear less.” (She couldn’t.) In the early ’90s, Sutton wrote the first positive stories on Babes in Toyland, at a time when the all-female trio were mostly mocked by the male-dominated local scene, and she also both documented and inspired the riot grrrl movement. “Reading Terri Sutton as teenage music fan and burgeoning feminist effectively gave me a path in life,” said Jessica Hopper, a writer and book series editor who contributed to the paper over the years. “Because City Pages had a feminist critic, I assumed, mistakenly and blessedly, in those pre-internet days, that every town had a feminist rock critic at their paper.” Will Hermes, a transplanted New Yorker who helped consolidate City Pages’ reputation as a home of great music writing when he became arts editor in 1993, said, “Minneapolis was such a hot music town that you could have almost justified focusing on what was happening locally, but they were ambitious.” (As Perry put it, “We thought of music criticism as a community having a bunch of conversations, and even though we were the No. 2 paper in a No. 15 market, we wanted to be part of that conversation.”) In the ’90s the paper paid attention to alt-country bands like the local group the Jayhawks and the frequent Minnesota visitors Wilco before the larger media caught on, and also charted the rise of the independent rap label Rhymesayers, which would have a national impact. The Village Voice was the model for Hermes, now a Rolling Stone and NPR contributor. “But the Voice could veer into critics writing for each other,” he said. “You couldn’t really get away with that, you had to communicate with a broader readership. My ideal was write something that is supersmart but try to hook somebody who might not even be interested in reading about music.” Hermes pointed to a cover feature dedicated to Kurt Cobain after the Nirvana leader’s death that collected thoughts and remembrances from Twin Cities musicians who knew Cobain, but also from local fans. “It was basically Facebook before Facebook,” he said. Under Hermes, City Pages established a culture of rigorous editing that continued after he left. “The editors had standards,” said Jon Dolan, a City Pages music editor in the late ’90s who now works at Rolling Stone. “There was no wannabe Lester Bangs going off on crazy rants.” Michaelangelo Matos, a regular contributor whose work included vital documentation of the Midwestern electronic music scene, said, “You couldn’t get an unnecessary sentence in that paper.” There was also always the sense that Minneapolis’s most famous artist was looking over your shoulder. Maybe it was just a legend that Prince read everything written about him in town. But you never knew when he might respond to criticism — as Maerz found out when, shortly after becoming music editor in 2001, she criticized some of his retrograde statements on gender roles. The 22-year-old Maerz was summoned to Paisley Park for an off-the-record one-on-one with the incensed star. “We had a pretty heated debate that ended with him storming out of the room,” Maerz said. “I was terrified, but also kind of thrilled.” The music section tried to balance the demands of web publishing with the standards of its editing tradition in recent years. “Every week felt like such a fight to keep some kind of integrity to what we were doing,” said Andrea Swensson, who was music editor when the New Times chain acquired the paper in 2006 and instituted digital publishing quotas. During the subsequent years, City Pages documented the rise of Bon Iver (from almost-local Eau Claire, Wis.) and helped introduce the world to the budding pop star Lizzo, the 2013 winner of Picked to Click, the best new music artist poll that Walsh started in 1991. And until the end, City Pages strove to remain a music writer’s paper where, as Walsh put it, an enthusiastic amateur could walk in the door and say to an editor, “I’d like to write this, I’d like to use the first person and I’d like it to sound smart. Help me.” "
7,The Best Half-Hour of Comedy in 2020 Is About … Scaffolding?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:35:00 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/television/john-wilson-scaffolding-hbo.html,Jason Zinoman,"On Sunday, a show with the blandest title on television (“How To With John Wilson”) dedicated an episode to the most boring subject imaginable (scaffolding) and produced the most fascinating comedy I have seen in years. This startlingly original new series, airing Sunday nights on HBO, has no stars or any kind of traditional story, and its main character, John Wilson, who co-writes, directs and narrates, stays offscreen. That it manages to be a poignant, hilarious and topical self-portrait is a small miracle. Like the best art, “How To With John Wilson” defies categorization, but as a critic, I can’t resist. It joins a growing genre of documentary comedy, which uses tools of journalism (like interviews with real people) for comic ends. The most famous examples, like the work of Sacha Baron Cohen, have a streak of cruelty that is absent here. Wilson’s sensibility is more humane than harsh, poetic than prankish. On the surface, he’s spoofing practical guides (“How to cook the perfect risotto” is the title of one episode), but that’s merely a framework for a multitude of digressions anchored in scenes of New York street life. His work resembles the remote segments produced by Merrill Markoe in the early years of “Late Night With David Letterman” and even more, the tender and wandering narratives of “Nathan for You,” whose star, Nathan Fielder, is a producer of Wilson’s show. The show is far more abstract than either of those forerunners; it’s rooted in deep dives into idiosyncratic themes. Sunday’s episode examined the wood and metal structures erected throughout the city to protect people from getting hit on the head. Scaffolding seems like a mundane subject, but through close attention, Wilson proves otherwise, finding it to be a source of safety and danger, a blight and a work of art, a big business, a cinematic cliché and a symbol of paralysis. What really fascinates him about scaffolding, and the core preoccupation of the show, is how easily something short-term becomes permanent. In a pocket history, Wilson explains how the death of one New Yorker in 1979 spawned an $8 billion a year industry that has built hundreds of miles of structures. Scaffolding workers, he argues, “do more to alter the landscape of New York than any other group.” He makes the point in myriad images, including a funny series of juxtapositions of famous buildings in movies versus real-world versions blanketed in metal rods and green wood that calls to mind the 2003 documentary essay “L.A. Plays Itself.” Wilson’s montages do what great chroniclers of the city accomplish: Make you see the familiar anew. The comedy is desert-dry old school wit. His deadpan narration spoofs the voice of God of many documentaries, often mumbling, shifting gears, tripping over itself. His voice is gentle, even uncertain, as if he’s thinking aloud. He delights in mismatches: when he says “beloved businesses,” he shows a Chase bank. Some of the jokes are so oblique they’re easy to miss. When he’s denied entry to a scaffolding convention, Wilson says wryly: “I was crushed.” There’s also humor out of magical realism. Wilson has a knack for finding bizarre and resonant moments in the everyday: An air-conditioner dangling from a window is as terrifying as a horror movie. A woman on a park bench calmly covered in birds is a still image from a child’s dream. An overweight man suddenly kicking the air flashes the grace of Bruce Lee. These stunning shots, each packing a feature film of mystery into a few seconds, come and go with dizzying speed, and are presented almost offhandedly, his camerawork aiming for a vérité vibe. Early on, Wilson asks a stranger if he has strong thoughts on scaffolding and the response is a baffled no. Then the camera stays on him for an additional beat, adding a pointed awkwardness and poking fun at this entire enterprise. At the core of the episode is an extremely relevant question for a moment when people are debating whether to take the train home for the holidays: What price safety? Everyone in New York is going to die, Wilson tells us at the start of the show, and there are times when he seems to be arguing that what began as a noble interest in avoiding injury is now driven primarily by business interests. Scaffolding obscures views, clutters streets and can even, when it breaks, kill. “You can waste your life playing it safe,” he says, “and the real danger is never what you expect it to be.” But this is no polemic against safety measures. You can also find arguments for the beauty and necessity of scaffolding and hear from pedestrians sentimental about it. One has a B.D.S.M. story about it told with a matter-of-factness that feels quintessentially New York. There’s a healthy realism from a blind man who says scaffolding makes it more difficult to get around the city. “You work with what you got,” he adds, holding a stick to feel his way around. Wilson is an entertainer and he isn’t trying to persuade. And while he makes it seem like he is just a lucky and persistent voyeur, an aimless wanderer who stumbles into these crazy stories and beautiful images, that is the real prank. Look closer and there is purpose in every shot. The home-movie aesthetic hides the instincts of a Hollywood showman. The first thing Wilson shows us is a jarring image of a wire toppling over a Mercedes-Benz on the streets of New York and the final shot is of a skyscraper being blown up. That makes it sound like an action movie, but it’s more of an inaction movie, a meditation on the allure and perils of not changing. By staying off camera, John Wilson makes the city seem like the focus, but the more you watch, the more prominent his voice becomes. He’s an unlikely romantic, one who sees excitement in tedium, beauty in trash and possibility everywhere. The show is more personal than political. Wilson emerges as an obsessive loner looking to make a connection. This becomes most evident in the sixth and final episode, when the crowded city streets transform as Covid-19 invades the picture and he becomes concerned about the health of his elderly landlord downstairs. We also see glimpses of his romantic life, but in Sunday’s episode, scaffolding is a metaphor for his own lack of commitment in his work life. In one tangent, he explains how to survive in the city, he made money filming infomercials for products like Roast-Beef-atopia. He said he knew he was “helping to create some of the most grotesque content on the planet,” but justified it by saying it was only for a short time. Then he did it for five years. Money jobs can operate like a kind of scaffolding, providing brief support, but stick with them long enough and they can become central to what you do and who you are. Life is funny like that, especially these days when security of any kind seems elusive and nothing is guaranteed. Toying with these darker currents, John Wilson seems melancholy but not despairing. He even finds hope in strange places, and an unexpected reminder: We are all ultimately temporary. "
8,Review: A Poet’s Urgent Questions Fuel ‘November’,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 22:14:05 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/theater/review-november-claudia-rankine.html,Maya Phillips,"Claudia Rankine is the prophet of Trump’s America. It’s a thankless job, and one that, to some extent, all Black Americans are qualified for, just by the nature of our presence in a country that disregards us. Of course none of this is new to Rankine, an award-winning poet, playwright and scholar whose anthropological examinations of whiteness have helped inform many of our recent conversations on race. In the rapidly assembled 51-minute film “November” — an adapted version of her play “Help” that was commissioned by The Shed but scuttled by the pandemic — Rankine and the director Phillip Youmans present a piece that, despite its self-consciously ornamental style, incisively conveys an urgent message of awakening for this America. “You’ve joined us here in our liminal space, a space neither here nor there, a space of quarantine and uncertainty,” one of five actress-narrators filmed onstage at the Shed begins. If you know Rankine’s work, this should sound familiar. Much of the play double-dips from the text of her 2019 New York Times Magazine article “I Wanted to Know What White Men Thought of Their Privilege. So I Asked” and her latest book, “Just Us: An American Conversation.” The script reflects on exchanges Rankine has had with white men in airports and on planes, alongside her typically cerebral musings on race relations and what she has termed the “racial imaginary,” a classroom-ready phrase describing the tension between one’s imagined notions of race — whether stereotyped or willfully ignored — and the reality. Zora Howard, Tiffany Rachelle Stewart, Crystal Dickinson, April Matthis and Melanie Nicholls-King trade off parts of the lengthy monologue, which is paired with visual metaphors that recall Rankine’s fondness for hybridity, as expressed in her books “Citizen” and “Just Us.” Other performers — including a white man, a stand-in for the kind of white masculinity Rankine describes — recur throughout, playing basketball at an outside court, laughing at a party or swimming in a public pool. Just a few weeks ago, I reviewed “Just Us,” a work that oftentimes feels too distant and meditative, as though stuck in the realm of race theory rather than the real world. “November” extracts the most striking language from its sibling and points it like a weapon at a racist America. “How many times have I been told not to be angry about my own murder?” one narrator asks. It’s one of many salient questions that Rankine offers in a tone both prodding and demanding of action. “Should I, the Black woman, just get on with the program of accommodating white men, their lives, their lies, their lines?” she asks. Later, as we watch a Black woman lying on a white floor silhouetted by flowers, we are asked to consider the deaths of Renisha McBride and Breonna Taylor: “Why do I have to die in order for you to live?” If you’re not grappling with why these questions are necessary right now, then you are doing something wrong. Though “Help” was originally slated to be performed by one Black female narrator surrounded by a bevy of white men, “November” radically changes that dynamic. Though the multiple narrators would seem to be a way to show multiplicity — all Black women, not just Rankine — the play’s structure doesn’t work hard enough to earn it. There are standout performers, though. Nicholls-King has the same unflappable coolness to her delivery as does the poet herself. And Howard, who is also a playwright, has both star quality and a powerful presence, as though each line were breathed directly into her body. (Her play “Stew,” featuring nimble dialogue and a bit of Shakespeare, beautifully told a tale of Black Americans stuck in a cycle of hardship and violence.) If only Youmans, who garnered acclaim for his award-winning feature-film debut, “Burning Cane” (which he wrote, edited and directed while still in high school), could fully honor Rankine’s dazzling words with his imagery. Her heady writing requires space for contemplation, but Youmans’s intercut shots tend to compete with it. The deliberately clumsy camerawork, shaky, unfocused and dizzying, reminded me of designer clothing that is meant to look distressed: art as calculated disarray. The whole aesthetic of the piece is affected: When we’re in the Shed, the narrators take to an empty stage with large chandeliers hanging from the ceiling behind them and three old TV sets, showing only static. The theater feels both underdressed and overwhelmed by the distracting radiance of the chandeliers. But in this way and many others, “November” does capture the liminal space, not simply in an airport terminal, but in our current state of affairs. Along with the staticky TV screens are other symbols of stalled progress: a Black couple in a car that eternally circles in a parking lot; underwater swimmers, coming toward and heading away from the camera. And of course, conceptually, “November” itself is in-between: theater and film, polemic and poem, documentary and interpretation. To watch “November” on Sunday night was to experience it in-between, as well. Over the next several days its concerns will take on monumental weight for many viewers worried about the election. Yet even though the film was created and produced over the last four weeks, “November” doesn’t point directly enough to the protests and the pandemic, both of which involved Black lives. Nor do we see the poll lines, stretching into the horizon, that represent racial injustice so acutely. That isn’t to say that Rankine doesn’t give us plenty to chew on; she always does. The past few years have made me freshly aware of my Blackness, in ways that are frightening and saddening and infuriating. Works like “November” remind me of what I find, as a Black woman, in everyday life: the slurs, the microaggressions. As I wait to see what our democracy brings this week, Rankine’s work makes me consider the thought: Am I, too, a prophet of this America? "
9,"Joan Bingham, Catalyst in a Publishing Merger, Dies at 85","Tue, 03 Nov 2020 00:34:00 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/books/joan-bingham-dies.html,Neil Genzlinger,"Joan Bingham, who played a key role in a merger that created the Grove Atlantic publishing house, then served almost three decades as its executive editor, acquiring and producing numerous prestigious titles, including Kiran Desai’s “The Inheritance of Loss” and collections by the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet Kay Ryan, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85. Her son-in-law, Joseph G. Finnerty III, said the cause was pneumonia. Ms. Bingham had already experienced glamour, accomplishment and tragedy when she helped found Grove Atlantic, which was formed in 1993 by the merger of Grove Weidenfeld and the Atlantic Monthly Press. She had married into the wealthy Bingham family, whose media holdings included the Kentucky newspapers The Louisville Times and The Courier-Journal, also in Louisville. Her husband, Robert Worth Bingham III, was thought to be destined for a prominent role in the family business, but he was killed in a freak accident in 1966. After that, Ms. Bingham made her own mark. In 1984 she was the founding publisher of The Washington Weekly, a spunky but short-lived publication that covered politics and culture in the nation’s capital. Later she edited a newsletter on economics in Paris. She then became the catalyst for Grove Atlantic. George Weidenfeld and Ann Getty (who died in September at 79) had created Grove Weidenfeld in 1986, incorporating the venerable Grove Press into the new company. Morgan Entrekin had taken over Atlantic Monthly Press in 1991. He knew Ms. Bingham’s daughter, Clara, and in a phone interview on Monday he said it was Joan Bingham who had provided the connection that led to the Grove-Atlantic merger. “She called me in the spring of 1992 and said, ‘Do you know anything about Grove Weidenfeld?’” Mr. Entrekin, Grove Atlantic’s publisher and chief executive, said. “Joan was really crucial in creating the whole thing.” Grove’s formidable backlist and Atlantic’s success with new titles seemed a good fit. But, Mr. Entrekin said, Ms. Bingham was more than just a matchmaker. “She put up some advance capital, became involved as executive editor, and away we went,” he said. Over the years she acquired and edited more than 100 titles, in fiction, nonfiction and poetry. There was “Triangle: The Fire That Changed America"" (2003), David Von Drehle’s account of the catastrophic Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire of 1911. There was “The Inheritance of Loss,” Ms. Desai’s best-selling novel, which won the Man Booker Prize in 2006. There was “Walk the Blue Fields,” Claire Keegan’s acclaimed story collection, from 2008. And there was a lot of poetry. Ms. Bingham helped create and oversaw the Grove Press Poetry Series. Among its first offerings was “Elephant Rocks” by Kay Ryan, an interesting voice because, as Mr. Entrekin noted, she was “an outlier,” not part of the strain of poets from academia. With Ms. Bingham championing her work, Ms. Ryan became prominent enough that, in 2008, she was named poet laureate of the United States. Her 2010 collection, “The Best of It: New and Selected Poems,” won the Pulitzer Prize. Joan Williamson Stevens was born on March 5, 1935, in Steubenville, Ohio. Her father, Edward, was chief executive of United Oil Company in Pittsburgh, and her mother, Helen Williamson Stevens, was a homemaker. Joan Stevens grew up in Sewickley, Pa., a suburb of Pittsburgh, and graduated from Miss Porter’s School in Connecticut in 1953. Four years later she graduated from Connecticut College with a degree in art history. She was studying at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco when, during a summer session at Harvard University, she met Mr. Bingham. They married in 1960. Mr. Bingham enjoyed outdoor activities. In July 1966 the family was vacationing in Nantucket, Mass., and Mr. Bingham hoped to do some surfing. Fitting the surfboard into their rented car required rolling down the windows and laying the board crosswise in the vehicle, the ends protruding out the windows on either side. With Mr. Bingham driving, one end of the board clipped a park car, causing it to pivot, whipping the board into Mr. Bingham’s neck and killing him. Ms. Bingham remained a director of the family company (which sold its media holdings in 1986) but settled in Manhattan and Washington. Once she entered the book-publishing field, her homes in both cities, with their walls of bookcases, became frequent stops for those in the business. “She was the irrepressible host of hundreds of dinners for Grove’s authors, booksellers and international publishers,” Elisabeth Schmitz, editorial director at Grove Atlantic and a colleague for a quarter-century, said by email. Ms. Bingham, she said, brought a vigor to her job even late in life. “Joan may have been our most senior colleague, but she was also certainly our most youthful and energetic spirit,” Ms. Schmitz said. “She would hike our four flights of stairs in the Union Square offices several times a day” — generally in one of her multiple pairs of All Stars sneakers. She attended international book fairs and accompanied her authors on tour. “She was a fierce, sometimes stubborn advocate on behalf of her writers,” Ms. Schmitz said, “and you couldn’t keep Joan out of our publicity director’s office if she had one on the verge of publication.” Ms. Bingham supported a number of charitable organizations. Her family said she was particularly passionate about the American School of Classical Studies at Athens and was a member of its board. Ms. Bingham’s brief marriage to George Packard in the late 1970s ended in divorce. Her son, Robert Worth Bingham IV, died of a drug overdose in 1999. In addition to her daughter, Clara Bingham, she is survived by three grandchildren. "
10,Review: ‘What a Carve Up!’ Is Wonderful. But Is It Theater?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 20:45:36 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/theater/what-a-carve-up-review.html,Alexis Soloski,"If you had asked me, sometime before this past March, to define theater, I might have hazarded something like this: an art form including at least one actor and at least one audience member, inhabiting the same place at the same time. Even back then I would probably have thought of a few counterexamples, the Theater of the Oppressed, say, or some conceptual stuff. But the basic parameters held. Now I’m not so sure. And I’ve never felt more confused than while watching “What a Carve Up!” a mostly very enjoyable collaboration among three English companies, the Barn Theater, the Lawrence Batley Theater and the New Wolsey Theater. It is streaming through Nov. 29, and a deluxe ticket includes a program and recipe cards mailed to your home for a sumptuous Indian meal to accompany the show. Those outside Britain have to make do with PDFs and hope they happen to have some cassia bark and paneer cubes on hand. To call “What a Carve Up!” a play, with or without chicken curry, well, that’s merely a term of convenience. The theaters have adapted this show from Jonathan Coe’s 1994 novel of the same name, a viciously funny — and often just plain vicious — indictment of English society in the Thatcher and Major years. A murder mystery in the blood-engorged vein of Agatha Christie’s “And Then There Were None,” Coe’s novel is also a triumph of postmodernism (yes, really), its cut-and-paste style seesaws among different perspectives and forms — newspaper articles, book excerpts, parody, pastiche, juvenilia. Imagine a game of Clue sledgehammered to bits and then reassembled with some extremely literary glue, and you’re nearly there. Ingeniously, the adapter Henry Filloux-Bennett and the director Tamara Harvey have given the piece a contemporary frame, drawing shrewd parallels between the excesses of the ’80s and the outrages of the present. In 1990, six members of the Winshaw family, lavishly immoral plutocrats who made the Murdochs look like the Waltons, were brutally murdered. Michael Owen (Samuel Barnett, in voice-over), a novelist tasked with writing a history of the Winshaws, stands accused. Michael dies just after. Filloux-Bennett brings the novel into the present by creating two contemporary characters, Raymond Owen (Alfred Enoch), Michael’s son, and Josephine Winshaw-Eaves (Fiona Button), the family’s only surviving member. Both of them were babies at the time of the murders, they are now about 30. Raymond, obsessed with the case, is assembling an amateur documentary reinvestigating the crime. He intercuts his own filmed narration with various archival clips — voiced by the likes of Stephen Fry, Sharon D. Clarke, Celia Imrie and Derek Jacobi — and scenes from a TV interview between Josephine and a skeptical journalist (Tamzin Outhwaite) on the subject of her family’s legacy, a neat visual translation of the book’s intertextuality. Like the novel, the show has a jigsaw-puzzle structure, asking you to rearrange the pieces until the picture comes into view. The form is intricate, the performances canny, and if it’s fleeter and less brutal than the novel, it still pokes its fingers into the same social wounds, inflicted by the same political party. Raymond (in Enoch’s approachable and moving performance) makes this explicit late in the piece. “Our hospitals are still crumbling, our bodies are still being poisoned, our spirits crushed,” he says. But even as I enjoyed the smarts and style of “What a Carve Up!” I couldn’t understand it as theater. It doesn’t suffer from what afflicts a lot of streamed productions, the despairing feeling that this thing wants to be a play and can’t. In a conversation included in the show’s program, Harvey mentions the conundrum of trying to “tell this story in a way that isn’t theater, isn’t telly and isn’t radio — that is entirely its own thing.” Maybe “What a Carve Up!” is entirely its own thing. But that thing isn’t theater. It’s more like a true-crime podcast (think “Serial” or “My Favorite Murder”) made fictional and visual through a series of tricky, starry YouTube videos with impressive literary pedigree. Each element has been meticulously prerecorded and edited, so while almost everything about it is very good, nothing about it is live. I have no quarrel with anything theaters do to survive and contribute and entertain during this time, especially now that Britain has entered a new lockdown. And I don’t believe that the pandemic sounds some knell for traditional drama. (That is however, Josephine’s contention: “We’ve got Netflix, babes. We don’t need you anymore.”) Yet here’s the real mystery at the heart of “What a Carve Up!”: not so much whodunit but why theaters in particular would do it at all. "
11,Clothes Make the Spy,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 02:01:30 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/fashion/mens-style-sean-connery-bond-suits.html,Guy Trebay,"It’s a footnote to a footnote, the tale of how, with the assistance of hair and makeup and a progressive London tailor, Sean Connery zeroed in on what came to stand as the enduring sartorial standard for spies. Yet the story is worth reprising because while the many front page obituaries for the star made a point of detailing the breadth of his accomplishments over a career spanning decades, no one can argue that his most indelible role wasn’t 007. What is less often noted is how Mr. Connery’s Bond image, like most everything concerning the most stylized spy in history, was as meticulously assembled as his Walther PPK. According to legend, Mr. Connery got the part after being spotted playing the implacable cad Count Vronsky in a 1961 BBC adaptation of “Anna Karenina.” It was less his handsome face, with its deeply grooved cheeks and the bushy eyebrows he deployed like sardonic brackets, that landed him the role than his feline way of moving. “We signed him without a screen test,” said Harry Saltzman, who produced the Bond films with Albert Broccoli, after seeing a clip of Mr. Connery walking. The film critic Pauline Kael, a longtime Connery devotee, was far from the only observer to tumble to his athleticism, his “richly masculine” vitality, as she wrote, and his commanding physical presence. Lana Turner chose Mr. Connery to play opposite her in the 1958 melodrama “Another Time, Another Place,” based on what was then termed animal magnetism (and nowadays is often referred to by a three-letter abbreviation for virile energy not printable in these pages). If anything, the 6-foot-2 Scotsman, a former bodybuilder and artists’ model, may have had more sexual vitality than required for the part of 007 as written: a character anchored in a “tradition of English ruling-class heroes” that had long dominated spycraft, as the British sociologist and author Tony Bennett wrote in “The International Journal of James Bond Studies” in 2017. Among the original candidates for the role of an MI6 toff were such war horses of Hollywood’s British colony as David Niven and James Mason. Eager to downplay the Bond character’s more glaring upper-class mannerisms for a franchise pitched toward an international audience, the producers instead chose the working class actor from an Edinburgh slum and set about moderating his assertive physical presence with the varied tools of sartorial suavity. Naturally they started at the tailor. Later spies like Jason Bourne would dress as anonymously as a garage attendant or lawn boy. But Bond was fitted for suits at the Anthony Sinclair establishment on Conduit Street at the northern end of Savile Row. The reason was simple: Terence Young, the director of “Dr. No,” the first of the official Bond films, ordered his suits there. Whether, as some have suggested, Mr. Young formed Bond in his image, there is no question that, as a former Irish Guards officer, intelligence officer and a product of elite public schools and Cambridge, he brought to the production an unusual level of knowledge and sophistication. For himself, as for Bond, Mr. Young preferred the military-inspired cut of Sinclair’s single-breasted jackets, with their natural shoulders and gently nipped waists to the boxy double-breasted suits Savile Row was still turning out well into the 1960s. If it happens that the details of Bond’s dress are often too subtle to register at first glance, that is probably as it should be. Still, the cavalry-cut trousers with crisp reverse pleats; the cocktail cuffs turned back like the French type, although fastened with buttons rather than links; the tight polos and blousy camp shirts seldom worn by any outside the leisured classes in that era; and even the crisp pocket handkerchiefs Bond wore neatly squared did not go unobserved by the style-conscious. Certainly it was noted by men’s wear designers. When it came time for Tom Ford to outfit Daniel Craig in his most recent Bond incarnation, he wisely turned to the Connery original for inspiration. He sharpened and decluttered an image that had grown fussy over time (the Brioni years, in particular, from “GoldenEye” to “Casino Royale” have failed to age well), while showcasing another hunk with his own set of distinctive physical assets. “Connery’s Bond embodied a new kind of masculinity for the time,” Italo Zucchelli, the onetime men’s wear designer for Calvin Klein, wrote in an email. “No matter if he was in a form-fitting, sculptured suit, a sharp tuxedo or showing off his chiseled body in a swimsuit, he exuded a sexuality that made him irresistible.” Often enough, it should be remembered, Mr. Connery’s Bond was nearly naked. Beefcake Bond was clearly the producers’ nod to evolving mores and an increased comfort among men — or, anyway, Mr. Connery — with being subjected to frank physical appraisal. It was also clearly a style. Mr. Young’s contribution to all of this was to keep things racy without careening into the red zone of camp. To that end, as Lois Maxwell, the Canadian actress who played the original Miss Moneypenny, once explained, Mr. Young tutored Mr. Connery in the ways of gentlemanly refinement, instructing him on how to walk and talk and even hold a fork. He conducted him to carriage trade purveyors like Swaine Adeney Brigg for Bond’s attaché case, John Lobb for his shoes and purportedly the sanctums of private men’s clubs to see how the upper-crust types on which Ian Fleming based his seductive professional killer disported themselves out of sight of the public. While Fleming was scant in his physical description of Bond (lavishing signifiers and adjectives instead on his villains), Mr. Connery, like every actor worth his salt, absorbed all he could from the text, as well as from Mr. Young and the unfamiliar worlds to which he was suddenly given access. And, like every human who ever gave thought to the performative nature of dressing, he grabbed hold of the props provided to him — a midnight blue Conduit Cut dinner jacket worn over a flat-front Turnbull & Asser shirt; a brown Sandow Trilby from Lock & Co; the polo shirts and suits in varied subtle tones of gray; even the infamous baby blue “Goldfinger’’ terry cloth onesie — and owned them.

12,Luke Combs Returns to No. 1 With a Streaming Record for Country Music,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 19:08:25 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/music/luke-combs-streaming-chart.html,Ben Sisario,"When the country everybro Luke Combs released his album “What You See Is What You Get” a year ago, it became a streaming blockbuster — a rare trophy in Nashville, which has lagged behind most other genres in the shift to streaming. With “What You See Ain’t Always What You Get,” a reissued version of that album, Combs has proved just how much he has learned from pop and hip-hop stars in driving clicks online. The new version opened at No. 1 on Billboard’s latest chart, with the equivalent of 109,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen Music; about 70 percent of that total was derived from the album’s 102 million streams. Lesson 1: Give your album another shot on the charts with a “deluxe” version. Reissues with added songs have become hip-hop’s most effective new gimmick, used by Lil Baby, Lil Uzi Vert, Nav, A Boogie Wit da Hoodie and others to extend the sales streaks for recent LPs. The new version of “What You See” has six tracks that were not on the original album. Lesson 2: Promote on TikTok. Again and again. Combs has two million followers on the bite-size video app, which has become the industry’s most reliable hit generator, whether that means Lil Nas X’s “Old Town Road” or Fleetwood Mac’s 43-year-old “Dreams.” Combs has been seeding the new version of “What You See” on TikTok for months, posting versions of his new songs, including “Forever After All,” which this week also opens at No. 2 on Billboard’s Hot 100 singles chart, just behind Ariana Grande’s brand-new “Positions.” Those tactics helped Combs get the most streams of any country album in a week, breaking the record he set last year. For a sense of just how far country music has come with streaming, before Combs, that record was held by Gene Autry — who died in 1998 but whose album “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer and Other Christmas Classics” had racked up 44 million streams during the 2018 holiday season. In addition to streams, “What You See” sold 22,000 copies as a complete package, and in an era of cratering single sales, songs from the album sold a remarkable 109,000 copies on download stores like iTunes. Also this week, Bruce Springsteen’s “Letter to You,” his first new album with the E Street Band in six years, opened at No. 2 and the rapper Ty Dolla Sign started at No. 4 with his new LP, “Featuring Ty Dolla Sign.” Two posthumous rap albums that have been steady hits since July continue to hold strong on the chart, with Pop Smoke’s “Shoot for the Stars Aim for the Moon” at No. 3, and Juice WRLD’s “Legends Never Die” at No. 5.

13,‘I Still Believe in Our City’: A Public Art Series Takes On Racism,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:52:46 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/arts/design/public-art-covid-race-subway.html,Lauren Messman,"On Tuesday, New Yorkers commuting through the Atlantic Avenue-Barclays Center subway station will find it transformed with vibrant portraits of Black, Asian and Pacific Islander people along with anti-discriminatory messages like “I did not make you sick” and “I am not your scapegoat.” The series is the work of the neuroscientist turned artist Amanda Phingbodhipakkiya (pronounced PING-bodee-bak-ee-ah). In August, Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya was named a New York City Public Artist in Residence through a program that has partnered artists with city agencies since 2015. She is one of two artists currently embedded with the city’s Commission on Human Rights. Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya’s “I Believe in Our City” series was created as a response to a grim statistic. From February to September, the Commission received more than 566 reports of discrimination, harassment and bias related to Covid-19 — 184 of which were anti-Asian in nature. It’s a troubling spike not just appearing in New York, but in Asian-American communities across the country. “My goal with this art series was to turn these hurts into something beautiful and powerful,” Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said in a phone interview. She added, “I really wanted to find a way to say, despite everything we have faced as Asian-Americans and New Yorkers, that I still believe in New York.” From Nov. 3 to Dec. 2, the series of 45 pieces will be displayed in the Atlantic Terminal in Brooklyn, a central hub that serves a diverse group of commuting New Yorkers. Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said that it was also the site of a reported, Covid-related bias incident in March, when a 26-year-old Asian-American man reported he was spat on. A description of that incident has been included in one of the pieces, alongside portraits of Asians and flowers that Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said have symbolic meanings in Chinese and East Asian cultures. Other panels offer information and historical context about the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and statistics about Asian-owned businesses. The series also features portraits of Black people as a sign of solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement and as a larger call to end institutional racism. “As you traverse the terminal and look upon Asian and Black faces, full of defiance and strength, and learn about the injustices that we’ve faced,” Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya said, “you can’t help but see us and you can’t help but feel that we are reclaiming space.” For Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya, whose parents are Thai and Indonesian, the series is personal. Growing up in Georgia before moving to New York 14 years ago, she said she and her family experienced anti-Asian bias firsthand. Through this series, she wanted to amplify those experiences, and those of others in her community, which oftentimes go unnoticed. “My art has always been about making the invisible visible,” she said. “I’ve explored everything from microscopic universes to outer space and things that just can’t be seen with the naked eye. And I think struggles of communities of color are often invisible.” After a monthlong display in Atlantic Terminal, art from the series will appear around various points of the city in bus shelters, LinkNYC kiosks and Department of Transportation display cases. There are also plans for a hand-painted mural to appear in the city, with the exact location yet to be announced. "
14,What in the World Is a $590 Scratch-and-Sniff T-shirt Doing in 2020?,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 18:12:26 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/style/scratch-and-sniff-Tshirt-lanvin.html,Caity Weaver,"The universe tends toward ever-increasing disorder; earlier this year, the luxury fashion house Lanvin released several varieties of scratch-and-sniff T-shirts priced at $590. At one time, the scented T-shirts would have been unscented hats, because that is what Jeanne Lanvin sold in the Parisian hat shop she opened in 1889, roughly one and one-quarter centuries before a multibillion dollar private Chinese conglomerate called Fosun International acquired a majority stake in the luxury fashion brand born of her enterprise. The shirts came in four sizes, three varieties and two genders — cherry (for men), blackberry (for women), and strawberry (for both). Their scents were faint but not subtle. A person standing nearer the wearer than manners permit would be met with the brazenly synthetic aroma of artificial fruits. The cherry T-shirt smelled of cherry-flavored cough drops. The blackberry T-shirt smelled purple, the flavor of artificial grape. Over email, a Lanvin representative insisted the scents “corresponded to the fruit that was pictured on the shirt.” At present, there are just about 7.7 billion people on this planet, and most of them couldn’t fashion you a scratch-n-sniff garment if you paid them. By this measurement, Lanvin comes out ahead. But does it make admirable use of its advantage? That is one of the thousands of questions the T-shirts inspire. There is also the riddle inherent in their design: What if (or, from Lanvin’s point of view, why don’t) certain things (e.g. T-shirt fabric) smell more like other things (e.g. grape gum)? If we assume, as it appears Lanvin does, that novel scents are intrinsically desirable in one’s clothes, why these scents? Why now? What is the cash value of a shirt that smells significantly more like cherry-flavored cough suppressant than other shirts? (The company’s optimistic guess: $590.) For how many days is a $590 T-shirt good before it turns, and is worth merely $295 (the shirts’ eventual discounted sale price)? Is it acceptable that some people enjoy the option to buy a scratch-n-sniff T-shirt that, with shipping, cost more than the supplemental $600 allotted weekly to 30 million unemployed Americans to keep them fed and housed after the initial eruption of the coronavirus pandemic? What do blackberries smell like? And why is the shipping not free? The New York Times purchased, on sale, one cherry-scented cherry shirt and one grape-scented blackberry shirt for a total, after taxes and shipping, of $631.24, and to whom should the apology be issued? To A. G. Sulzberger, the newspaper’s publisher, for allocating a portion of his publication’s budget in this way? Or to a person who could have really used $631.24 — for instance, any resident of Florence, Ky., who was recently transported by ambulance and subsequently charged that city’s standard $630 ambulance fee? Would it be better to disperse the apology among many people — for instance, hundreds of New Yorkers who walked on any particular occasion to avoid spending $2.75 on subway fare? (Or would any apology be hollow since the money was not taken directly from these individuals’ coffers?) If three people purchase full-price yearlong digital subscriptions to The Times as a result of reading this article — this article specifically — the scented T-shirts could, in a technical sense, offset their own cost. Would their purchase be justified at that point, or is it immoral and preposterous under all conditions? What does $631.24 mean at this particular moment in time? Scratch-and-sniff is a feature, a deed and a technology derived from the experiments of Gale Matson, a chemist who grew up in a small town in Minnesota and later went to work for his local global manufacturing conglomerate, the Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company. One of Mr. Matson’s first tasks after joining the company was to refine the practice of producing ink copies of documents without the use of messy black carbon paper. While tweaking a manufacturing technique known as microencapsulation in 1966, he invented what we now know as scratch-and-sniff. Its basic concept is this: A bunch of itty-bitty plastic-coated balls, filled with scented substance, can be made to rupture with light physical contact (Mr. Matson suggested “fingernail pressure”), releasing their scent into the air. Mr. Matson’s patents describe how he created capsules filled with “one part perfume oil and two parts diethyl phthalate,” and coated them onto a sheet of paper. The paper remained odorless until the capsules were scratched open. Since the 1960s, forms of microencapsulation have been used to preserve attractive colored stripes in toothpaste and to create the mysterious liquid crystal substance inside mood rings. Today, a common application is masking the bitter taste of pharmaceutical drug ingredients. The same technology is imbued, as we know, in scratch-n-sniff stickers, stamps, wall paper, album covers and T-shirts. Gale Matson died in 2004 after more than 30 years at the company, which is known today as 3M. Its scarlet logo appears on products ranging from neonatal monitoring electrodes to helicopter blade repair paste to Scotch tape. “He loved working at 3M,” Mr. Matson’s son Tim recalled. “They say you bleed 3M red.” “I never got to see where he worked, because it was in a secure location,” he added. “Until they patented something and disclosed the inventions, it was all trade secrets and tight security.” Tim Matson said his mother recalled receiving gifts of French perfume left over from his father’s experiments. Two of the perfumes the elder Mr. Matson microencapsulated in the Minnesota laboratory were “My Sin” and “Arpège” — fragrances created for Lanvin in the 1920s. The thing about a $590 T-shirt is that, upon acquiring one, you immediately become the human assistant to a $590 T-shirt. Your compensation for this role is capped at the amount of joy you personally are able to derive from the act of wearing it. Besides the basic maintenance of the T-shirt — which involves ironing out the stubborn creases formed in its cardboard journey across land and sea, and handwashing the cotton to preserve the scent of the fruit cartoon (the cherry scent vanished after a single wash and wear; the blackberry shirt was never washed for fear of same) — there is an additional component of mental exhaustion. There is the temptation, always, to remove the T-shirt before eating, or engaging in light physical activity, or setting foot outdoors in case it attracts bees — behavior that would seem to undermine the act of purchasing a supposedly wearable item in the first place. Alternatively, you could wear it normally and end up with a $590 no-longer-scented cherry-scented very-short-sleeved T-shirt with a faint indelible enchilada sauce stain on the front, and two tiny holes on the back near the bottom hem — holes whose origin is as enigmatic to you as that of the electron, you having given this T-shirt every possible comfort and advantage in life — that you cannot even donate it, because who would want to receive a stained, punctured T-shirt, now devoid of the original selling factor, which must have been, had to have been, that this T-shirt can be made to evoke the unmistakable scents of artificial fruits? A spokesman for Lanvin said that the shirts were digitally printed; that the scratch-n-sniff scent was meant to remain for up to 50 washes; and that the idea came to Lanvin’s creative director, Bruno Sialelli, after he encountered a green tea-scented shirt on vacation in Okinawa. The earliest synthetic fruity flavors, many produced from compounds still used in flavorings today, were offshoots of the Industrial Revolution — literally. They originated as byproducts of coal or fuel oil processing, or were leftover from the distillation of pure alcohol. Nadia Berenstein, a flavor historian, said that then-new industries based on burning fossil fuels shed “all of these carbon rich molecules” that chemists could “then play with and manipulate in various ways to kind of reorganize them.” By changing the molecules’ structure — by heating them, for instance, or adding sulfuric acid to form new compounds — early flavor scientists could alter their sensory qualities. “Scent” is a tidy noun to describe a tremendous riot of molecules volatile enough to fly up into our nasal cavities, where sensory receptors describe them to our brains. The majority of scents we encounter in everyday life are made up of large, complex combinations of chemical compounds — often several hundred apiece. To replicate a scent exactly, down to the molecular level, therefore requires an astronomic level of precision and effort. Fortunately for those who would seek to replicate scents, a close approximation is generally good enough to satisfy. John Wright, a British-born flavor chemist and a former vice-president for International Flavors & Fragrance, one of the world’s largest manufacturers of tastes and smells, compared creating scents to drawing the Prince of Wales. “What you think about Prince Charles in the U.K. is: He’s got big ears that stick out. So if you do a cartoon of him and you make the ears bigger, there’s obviously a point where you would turn him into Dumbo, and he wouldn’t be Prince Charles anymore,” Mr. Wright said. Similarly restrained judgment, he added, must be exercised in scent re-creation. The goal is to identify a few key elements people use to identify a particular scent, he said, “and accentuate them just a little bit — not so much. So that the ears are still Prince Charles, but a bit bigger than they are in real life.” For cherries, that compound (benzaldehyde) is associated with a strong bitter almond note. The prevalence of benzaldehyde in artificial cherry formations is “not so true of actual cherries,” said Mr. Wright. “It’s something that’s often exaggerated and sometimes exaggerated far too much.” But authenticity is not necessarily the aim. The appeal of the artificial flavorings at the time of their creation, said Dr. Berenstein, was their novelty. Thanks to the sudden proliferation of mass-market confectionaries (itself a result of increased white sugar production at ever higher purities), flavors like fake strawberry became so widespread they entered what Dr. Berenstein called Americans’ “mass cultural sensory experience of the range of things that we associate with strawberryness.” In other words, “I think the fake flavors tend to shape our expectations for what real things should taste like,” said Dr. Berenstein. Early flavorists were not in the business of deciphering the molecular template of, say, a true apple (an arduous task that would have required reducing what Dr. Berenstein described as “a literal ton of apples” to a couple of millimeters of volatile aromatic oil). They were scientists taking note of the scents of the new substances with which they had begun experimenting. The chemical amyl valeranate, some of them noticed, smelled somewhat apple-y. Why not market it as “apple essence”? Some of these scent chemists’ preliminary guesses about fruit flavor composition were remarkably accurate; certain of their intuited compounds were later discovered to be present in the fruits themselves. In the case of artificial banana flavoring, it didn’t even matter, at first, how closely the flavoring matched the fruit’s true taste. “Artificial banana-flavored things in the U.S. were widely available about 10 years before actual bananas were,” said Dr. Berenstein, “so it’s really likely that people in this country ate banana-flavored candy before they had actually had a banana.” Today, Dr. Berenstein said, it’s possible to determine accurate chemical compositions much more precisely: “You put a sample of strawberry aroma into a gas chromatograph mass spectrometer, and you’ll get a readout that lists maybe three or 400 different chemical components that are volatile in it.” Thus, while it may be possible for Lanvin to create a shirt that smells exactly like true blackberries — which, when purchased from the supermarket, give off only a faint odor of damp forest — the resulting scent might not be one most people would find pleasant. “Maybe people would be repelled from buying clothing that already smelled a little bit like dirt,” Dr. Berenstein said. There is something poetic, at least, in the Lanvin shirts’ concept. “Smelling is a proximity sense. You have to be in the same room as something to smell it,” Dr. Berenstein said. “Covid, for a lot of people, manifests as this loss of the sense of taste and smell that persists even after the disease is over.” “And one of the things about being in isolation is that we can look at other people through Zoom, and through our screens, but we’re not smelling other things. We’re not smelling other bodies,” she said. “The digital world is scentless and odorless.” Smell is also intimately connected to our memories. Odors and scents are chemically suited to trigger nostalgia. With this in mind, I inhaled the cotton with the urgent indignity of a drowner spat upon dry land. Yet the physical act of shirt-smelling sent my mind rummaging through childhood memories unrelated to the scents themselves. I am certain I received the occasional scented sticker on an elementary school quiz, but in my recollection, early cognizant years smelled of “unscented” things: wood pencils compulsively shaved to switchblade sharpness; painted metal from hands clung to antiquated and impractical playground structures; the soft old paper smell of communal class paperbacks; suffocating clouds of chalk clapped free from felt erasers (though clapping erasers was forbidden for this reason). Trying to prise nostalgia from the shirts, I instead flashed back to the comforting sniffs I would take of my clothes and hair on the car ride home from my grandmother’s house, luxuriating in the pleasant “Nana” scent that would envelop me until they were washed. That aroma was strong. It was steeped. It was, my mother pointed out, smoke from my grandmother’s constant puffing of cigarettes; even now, if I pass a smoker on the street, my first thought is of immaculate housekeeping. Is the swell of these memories, however unconnected from artificial fruit scents, a $590 experience, or perhaps priceless? “I would be really surprised,” Dr. Berenstein said, “if the cost of putting these aromas onto these shirts is more than a couple of dollars.” A new banana-scented T-shirt will be available from Lanvin in January. It will retail for $350. "
15,"Book Review: ‘The Best of Me,’ by David Sedaris","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 19:20:06 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/books/review/david-sedaris-the-best-of-me.html,Andrew Sean Greer,"THE BEST OF MEBy David Sedaris I began reading “The Best of Me,” David Sedaris’s new collection, on an airplane over the Atlantic. I was covered in prophylactic measures and heavily dosed on sleeping pills, which might explain the curious notes I have since discovered in the margins. “I had a brother-in-law named The Rooster” is one poignant example, but what is one to make of the terrifying scribble, “AH FEAR!,” I ask you? Or, most mysterious of all: “348263947” — either a stranger’s passport number or the combination to a bank vault. Was I planning a false identity? A heist? Perhaps we shall never know, so let us rely instead upon my final note, which reads: “This is the best thing Sedaris has ever written.” In the non-narcotic light of day, I stand by it. Strange, since “The Best of Me” is a collection of writing. Ordinary readers (and I am the most ordinary of readers) will be expecting a flamboyance of favorites, from his leap to NPR stardom with “Santaland Diaries” and his quarter-century rock-star journey from 1994’s “Barrel Fever” to 2018’s “Calypso.” Ordinary readers, however, will be wrong. This is not some Sedarian immaculate collection; instead, as he himself writes in the introduction, the pieces “are the sort I hoped to produce back when I first started writing, at the age of 20.” They are what he hoped he would be. They are the best of him. Has Sedaris included “Santaland Diaries”? He has not. Has Sedaris included “The Motherless Bear,” a work of fiction that elicited a great deal of hate mail, including entreaties to donate to bear-rescue organizations? He has. Is Amy here? Yep. His mom? His dad? The Rooster who becomes The Juicester? Bien sûr. In fact, this book is all about his family and … all right, I’ll say it: love. No point planning a heist; Sedaris has opened the vault himself. The genius of “The Best of Me” is that it reveals the growth of a writer, a sense of how his outlook has changed and where he finds humor. In his early fiction — the hilariously petty tyrants of “Glen’s Homophobia Newsletter Vol. 3, No. 2” and “Front Row Center With Thaddeus Bristol” — Sedaris finds it in cruelty: “In the role of Mary,” Thaddeus remarks in his review of Sacred Heart Elementary’s Christmas pageant, “6-year-old Shannon Burke just barely manages to pass herself off as a virgin.” That cruelty continues in Sedaris’s pseudo-autobiographical work, but the monster we are seeing through is “David Sedaris.” In “The Incomplete Quad,” he imagines his family envying his life: “Me, the winner.” Paragraph break, next paragraph: “I was cooking spaghetti and ketchup in my electric skillet one night. …” It is a delicious pleasure to understand an obliviousness that Sedaris (supposedly) does not. “There weren’t many people I truly hated back then,” he tells us about his prepubescent self in “Memory Laps,” “30, maybe 45 at most.” The subject, in many of the pieces Sedaris has selected, is the judgment and pain we inflict on one another, and by “we” Sedaris does not mean people in general. He means him. And he means you. And he means me. Then, after the wicked glee of finding humor in pain (and I recommend reading the first volume of Sedaris’s diaries, “Theft by Finding,” to see how true this is to his nature), we arrive at a series of grace notes. The dangers of taking chances for gay men in a previous era, and the loves thereby lost, are movingly described in “A Guy Walks Into a Bar Car,” and for those obsessed with the character of Hugh, there is much of him as well, appearing almost in reverse: as a front-seat passenger in “Possession” and a dubious boyfriend in “Dentists Without Borders,” until at last, 300 pages in, he and David are introduced. But it is the Sedaris family that carries the book: from childhood — when David persuades the toddler Tiffany to lie down in front of cars to cause grief to their mother, who has locked them out in the snow for being insufferable — to adulthood, cackling over bestiality magazines with Amy — to growing old, with its concomitant sorrows and, most surprising of all, happiness. “Happiness is harder to put into words,” Sedaris writes in “Leviathan,” one of the final essays. “It’s also harder to source, much more mysterious than anger or sorrow.” It is miraculous to read these pieces placed close together, the earliest written without any knowledge of where things would lead, the last guffawing at the ridiculousness of where they did. “Look how our lives turned out!” he imagines himself and his sisters thinking as they shop for absurd clothing in “The Perfect Fit.” “What a surprise!” Not everything turns out OK. If you have not read all of Sedaris, then I will not spoil the grief, or the joy, of his family’s arc. And if you have read all of Sedaris, well, then you have probably spent the intervening years entering the cartoon contests in the back of The New Yorker and baking prune challahs and pickling your children in adoration and rage and have therefore forgotten everything. Time to start again. You must read “The Best of Me.” It will be a new experience, knowing that enough time has passed to find humor in the hardest parts of life. More than ever — we’re allowed to laugh. "
16,"A Local’s Tour of Asturias, Spain’s ‘Natural Paradise’","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 10:00:27 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/travel/asturias-spain.html,Mónica R. Goya,"At the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, with travel restrictions in place worldwide, we launched a new series — The World Through a Lens — in which photojournalists help transport you, virtually, to some of our planet’s most beautiful and intriguing places. This week, Mónica R. Goya shares a collection of images from northwest Spain. Asturias, a region in northwest Spain that’s separated from the Castilian Plateau by the Cantabrian Mountains, is a land of contrasts. Once an industrial and mining powerhouse, the area has earned its nickname, Natural Paradise; a third of its territory is now environmentally protected. This year I had the chance to spend over two months there. It was a unique opportunity to rediscover my homeland after a decade spent living abroad. Asturias boasts a range of forests — oak, beech, chestnut, birch — and a mostly unspoiled coastline. Its beaches come in all sizes: a palette of turquoise blue waters surrounded by imposing cliffs and green pastures. Traces of the region’s pastoral heritage are still visible. On a hike through chestnut woods, I spotted a corripa, a circular stone enclosure built near a tree to store its chestnuts in their burrs, a way of prolonging their shelf life. The region is also dotted with hórreos, ancient wooden granaries built on stilts, and protected by heritage status since the 1970s. And since tending the land is rooted in the soul of many locals, you’re never far from a bursting vegetable garden. Asturias is home to just over a million people, half of whom live along the region’s midline, where its main three towns are: Oviedo, the capital city, which showcases immaculately preserved pre-Romanesque architecture, and the harbor towns of Gijón and Avilés. Somiedo, one of Asturias’ seven UNESCO biosphere reserves, is as far as it gets from the sun-drenched Spain of most people’s imagination. There, I was moved by the timeless beauty of the teitos, little thatched roof huts scattered across the emerald valleys. Often associated with the pre-Roman settlements known as castros, these traditional buildings are an important part of the culture of the Vaqueiros de Alzada, a nomadic people who practiced a transhumant lifestyle and who used to stay in the teitos while moving their cattle to the high mountain grazing pastures in the summer. Today there is an emerging movement to prevent this cultural heritage from vanishing. Western Asturias, where Cantabrian brown bears roam free, is considered the cradle of rural tourism in Spain. (The bears’ presence is on the rise, a result of conservation efforts.) There, castros abound and stone houses with slate roofs are the norm. Ancient oak forests — such as Muniellos, the largest in Spain and one of the best preserved in Europe — as well as beech and birch woods are at their prettiest in autumn, when the deciduous trees put on a show. Across Spain, many areas that are partially uninhabited because of a rural exodus come back to life in the summer. On the way to my grandmother’s village, I took the slower route, visiting the charming fishing villages of Llastres, Cudillero and Luarca. I took time to reflect on the many rural Spaniards who emigrated to the Americas over a century ago — and to reflect on the legacy of the indianos, the few who made fortunes abroad and returned to their hometowns to build grandiose mansions and, sometimes, schools, thereby helping to reduce the widespread illiteracy among the rural classes into which they were born. Picos de Europa, created in 1918, is the only national park in Asturias. Its exquisite natural beauty cannot be understood apart from the shepherds who for centuries have shaped the park’s landscapes, tending their livestock and producing award-winning cheeses such as Cabrales and Gamonéu, still aged in difficult-to-access caves. Around 80 percent of all Spanish cider is produced in Asturias, and sidrerías, or cider houses, are a staple in society. Local customs call for natural cider — which is traditionally poured into a wide-mouth glass from high above — to be drunk quickly, in one go. The local cuisine is hearty, the portions abundant and locals’ gluttonous reputation not unfounded. Despite the never-ending engineering works to link Asturias with Madrid by high-speed rail (a project scheduled to be completed by 2010 and still underway), visitor numbers are increasing annually. Last year, a record 2.3 million visited Asturias, 82 percent of them Spanish nationals. And yet, in August, Asturias is a green oasis where I can blissfully find trails to walk in silence for hours without encountering another soul.

17,"Book Review: ‘Collected Stories,’ by Shirley Hazzard","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 10:00:02 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/books/review-collected-stories-shirley-hazzard.html,Dwight Garner,"The Australian-American writer Shirley Hazzard (1931-2016) wrote her first short story when she was 28. She sent it to The New Yorker, where it fell into the hands of William Maxwell, who would go on to publish nearly all her stories. She’d bring one in and he’d read it in her presence while repeating the word “Yes.” There was much to say yes about. Hazzard’s stories are shrewd, formal and epigrammatic. One feels smarter and more pulled together after reading them. You drop into one as if you were a wet cell phone and it were a jar of uncooked rice. Her short fiction has been gathered now, in “Collected Stories,” into a single important and elegant volume. The book is divided into three natural sections. The first tranche of stories is from “Cliffs of Fall” (1963). These are about condescending, pitilessly detached men and the trapped women who love them — and they’re simply brutal. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of November. See the full list. ] The middle section contains stories from “People in Glass Houses” (1967). This book is sometimes considered a novel but reads plausibly as linked short fiction. It’s about the soul-draining imbecilities of office life at an organization that resembles the United Nations. Hazzard, who never attended college, worked unhappily at a low-level job with the U.N. in New York City when she was young, and she became a lifelong critic of that organization. (See her nonfiction books “Defeat of an Ideal” and “Countenance of Truth: The United Nations and the Waldheim Case.”) The stories in “People in Glass Houses” display her flaying wit. You could derive from them a dazzlingly dark television comedy, Paddy Chayefsky meets “The Office.” The stories in the final set are previously unpublished. These are closer to vignettes than fully fledged stories, yet they’re recognizably Hazzardish; perhaps the adjective I’m searching for is Hazzardous. Hazzard pivoted in her career from short stories to novels, from the sprint to the marathon. Her best-known novels are “The Transit of Venus” (1980), which won a National Book Critics Circle Award, and “The Great Fire” (2003), which won a National Book Award. While accepting the National Book Award, Hazzard gently set the crowd alight. Earlier in the evening, Stephen King had received a lifetime achievement award and, from the podium, had championed “popular” writers and proposed a reading list of his favorites. When Hazzard came to the microphone, she dryly remarked that King’s list wasn’t “much of a satisfaction.” After the 1960s, Hazzard rarely returned to the short story form. But her “Collected Stories” shows a mature talent. She dispensed intelligence and irony as if each were fresh herbs in a reticule she kept tied to the belt of her dress. Many of the stories about men and women unhappily in love are set abroad, often in Italy. Her characters, if not always wealthy, have well-stocked minds. They quote poetry. One character says of another, “He’ll get old quite suddenly and look like Somerset Maugham.” Another says, “You look like an allegorical figure.” Her people are alone and lonely even in the company of others. “You don’t know how isolated one feels,” a woman says. “You have so many — attachments.” Her illicit lover replies: “You make me sound like a vacuum cleaner.” Hazzard’s dialogue is parched yet on point. She has a habit of inserting talk into long sections of observation about gardens and the natural world. I don’t always treasure long observations about gardens and the natural world, but I do when Hazzard makes them. About an Englishman in Tuscany, for example, we read, in lines that make you sense the poverty of our weather reports: “He had never experienced such a sky. In England, where heaven is a low-hung, personal affair, thoroughly identified with the King James Version, a sky such as this would not have been tolerated for a moment. It was a high, pagan explosion of sky, promising indulgence for all kinds of offenses to which he had not the slightest inclination. He felt, beneath it, exposed and ridiculed.” The women in Hazzard’s stories have few options. (In her later novels, they have multiple avenues of escape.) The chilly men tend to be academics, not fiction writers. But reading these stories I was reminded of one of John Updike’s late poems, in which he admitted, with regret: “I drank up women’s tears and spat them out / as 10-point Janson, Roman and ital.” The men in Hazzard’s stories are avid consumers of tears. They hurt women with the nonchalance of a fishmonger snipping the faces off soft-shell crabs. It is not a pretty sight. About one woman in need of solitude, Hazzard writes: “One can’t ask to be left alone, she thought, or not to be touched, even once in a great while, without creating a scene — without changing everything.” Her intelligent women do see these men plainly. After a remark that men are concerned with cause and not consequence, we read: “It was the way men’s minds worked, she supposed; the process, in fact, by which the world was provided with machines and roads and bridges — and ruins.” Her men manage to avoid the pitfalls of love by never entirely falling in it. The stories about the U.N.-like organization are artful about the perils of small men and large bureaucracies. Hazzard wrings pathos and drama from small events, like denied promotions. In a character named Sadie Graine — “Sadie,” the author implies, is the diminutive of Sadist — Hazzard gives us the Nurse Ratched of secretaries. Graine terrorizes entire departments. Men and women are shuffled between floors, where they work for the comically named Bureau of Lateral Substitutions or toil on projects like Peaceful Uses of Atomic Weapons and Forceful Implementation of Peace Treaties. They worry about being dispatched to study drainage in, say, Kuala Lumpur. Hazzard’s stories feel timeless because she understands, as she writes in one of them: “We are human beings, not rational ones.” "
18,"A Biting Send-Up of Race Relations — and a Tender, Funny Middle Grade Novel","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 07:28:24 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/books/review/class-act-jerry-craft.html,Dave Kim,"CLASS ACTBy Jerry Craft It’s the first day of eighth grade and Drew Ellis is already stressed. Curious hands keep reaching for his hair, newly styled in a kinky hi-top. A white student who has a crush on him has burdened him with a giant sweet potato pie. Such is life as a Black student at the private Riverdale Academy Day School, or RAD, the setting of Jerry Craft’s new graphic novel, “Class Act.” You can imagine a lot of New York parents throwing elbows for a spot at RAD. Class sizes are small, and students sit Socratic-style at round tables. The library is top-notch, and athletic and arts programs are well funded. Plus, RAD has the kind of curated diversity in which a just-right sprinkle of children of color enriches the educational experiences of a white majority. It’s the perfect setup for a moving and often very funny story about the convergence of an awkward age (13 to 14) with an awkward age (America’s racial reckoning). “Class Act” is the sequel to Craft’s introspective, Newbery Medal-winning book, “New Kid,” in which a 12-year-old named Jordan Banks arrives at RAD as a wide-eyed transplant from Washington Heights. In this follow-up, Drew, one of Jordan’s closest pals, struggles with both the privileged realm of RAD and his life in the Co-op City section of the Bronx, where his childhood buddies call him a “bougie” snob who “ain’t really like us no more.” Drew feels lost. His teacher Mr. Roche, a walking microaggression in a skinny tie, recruits him and another Black student to make a visiting group of South Bronx eighth graders feel at home. “Shoot, I don’t even feel at home here,” he says. The tour is just one of several well-intentioned but fumbled efforts by RAD to “build a bridge” and emphasize commonality among cultures that most students and teachers know painfully little about. Mr. Roche starts an “affinity group” called Students of Color Konnect, or SOCK, bringing doughnuts to the first meeting to show how they are “all different but all delicious.” It doesn’t go well. For Drew, these failed exercises are proof that students like him don’t belong. Craft shapes an antagonist in Andy Peterson, a white student who resents that Drew has replaced him as quarterback and doesn’t see what good all this diversity and inclusion business does anybody. “If you don’t feel comfortable,” he says, “that’s not my fault!” His MAGA-red ball cap is no coincidence (and perhaps a bit heavy-handed). Craft’s rendering of Uptown Manhattan and the Bronx is immediately recognizable, from the ubiquitous “Injured?” billboards to the beloved Word Up bookstore in Washington Heights. He balances his biting sendup of American race relations with poignant family portraits, and the art is most striking in quiet moments when Drew, Jordan and their friend Liam are at home, wrestling with their emotions. Jordan, playing a supporting role in this book, serves as a middleman between Drew and Liam, a white student whose family is extravagantly wealthy but also cold and dysfunctional. Drew becomes more distant from Liam as his frustration with RAD entitlement grows, until the friends visit each other at home and see how the other lives. Their reconciliation is convincing and powerful. Maybe RAD and other institutions are missing the point with their doughnut summits: The very difficult work of antiracism isn’t about asserting sameness; it begins with understanding and appreciating difference. You can’t build a bridge, after all, without knowing what’s on the other side. "

He was 30. Mr. Hassell was shot outside his girlfriend’s apartment in Grand Prairie, a Dallas suburb, around 1 a.m., according to the representative, Alan Mills. He was shot in the abdomen and taken to a nearby hospital, where he died, Mr. Mills said. Police officers responded to the scene of the shooting around 1:50 a.m. local time and found Mr. Hassell wounded by gunfire, Mark Beseda, a spokesman for the Grand Prairie Police Department, said in an email. Officers administered first aid and Mr. Hassell was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead, Mr. Beseda said. The police were investigating possible motives for the shooting, Mr. Beseda said. A car that was taken from the scene was later recovered, he said. Mr. Mills said he saw reports of Mr. Hassell’s death earlier Sunday on social media and contacted the Hassell family. A cousin of the actor confirmed his death, Mr. Mills said. Mr. Beseda said that Mr. Hassell lived in Waco, Texas. Mr. Hassell appeared in 10 episodes of “Surface,” a sci-fi show staring the actress Lake Bell, about “a new, and often dangerous, species of sea life,” which aired from 2005 though 2006, according to IMDB. In the 2010 movie “The Kids Are All Right,” Mr. Hassell played Clay, the pill-snorting teenager whose friends (Josh Hutcherson and Mia Wasikowska) are being raised by two moms (Julianne Moore and Annette Bening) when they meet their biological father (Mark Ruffalo). In the 2013 film “Jobs,” Mr. Hassell played Chris Espinosa, a bespectacled 16-year-old who is roped into building circuit boards for a neighbor named Steve Jobs, played by Ashton Kutcher. In one of his last acting credits, Mr. Hassell appeared in the 2017 movie “Bomb City,” a crime thriller about punk rockers in a conservative town in Texas. Eddie Hassell was born on July 16, 1990, in Corsicana, Texas, near Dallas, according to IMDB. By age 11 he had moved to Los Angeles to start acting and ended up finding a new hobby there, according to a 2013 profile that appeared in Elle magazine. “Skateboarding’s been a huge part of my life; it also got me cast in commercials,” Mr. Hassell told the magazine. “I was into horseback riding and rodeos in Texas and when I moved to L.A., I got into skating. I did all my own stunts. I’m into anything with a board: surfing, wakeboarding.” "
21,"‘Fargo’ Season 4, Episode 7: Down in the Dirt","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 04:00:05 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/television/fargo-recap-episode-7.html,Scott Tobias,"What if Michael Corleone hadn’t been up for the job? That’s the question that hangs over “The Godfather” after Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the don of the Corleone crime family, dies of a heart attack and Michael (Al Pacino) takes the helm. At that point in the film, there’s ample evidence that Michael is a shrewd and coolheaded decision maker, but he’s also the youngest of Vito’s sons and the most removed from the business, having served as a Marine in World War II and started a life with a woman who wants nothing to do with it. He is thrown into a feud among the “Five Families” of New York and coolly arranges a coordinated series of killings during a baptism. “Fargo” wonders what might have happened if Michael Corleone had been every bit as vulnerable as his adversaries might have assumed. Because the Faddas don’t have a Michael. The Faddas have a Sonny (James Caan) in Gaetano, a macho thug who acts impulsively and violently to any perceived threat, and they have a Fredo (John Cazale) in Josto, whose weakness manifests itself as lethal ineptitude. Josto is the capo, but he’s incapable of confronting problems directly, leading to a lot of behind-the-scenes machinations that wind up blowing up in his face. He’s like a would-be puppet master who keeps tangling up the strings. There haven’t been many deep connections between this season of “Fargo” and the Coens’ film, beyond maybe the “Minnesota nice” qualities of Oraetta Mayflower, who’s a conspicuous out-of-towner in its Kansas City setting. But Josto embodies a common Coen type: the criminal dilettante who is undone by his own pettiness and amateurism. He and Gaetano are both sources of senseless violence, all of which has softened the Faddas’ edge over the Cannons, who are outmanned and at a severe cultural disadvantage. And this week, Josto’s mistakes continued to pile up. In this mostly lively episode, Josto and Loy are frequently juxtaposed for their leadership styles and their decision-making, which usually result in forcing Loy to try to sort through Josto’s missteps. For example, Josto’s plan to have one of his henchmen execute Loy’s son Satchel predictably failed, but his solution is to dig a deeper hole for himself. He tells Loy the boy is dead, pinning the blame on Gaetano’s right hand, Constant Calamita, in the hope that the Cannons will take on the ugly business of killing Calamita themselves. Never mind that the lie about Satchel’s death will almost certainly result in pushing Loy to kill the Italian boy they adopted as collateral in the original deal between the two families. Josto’s true war is with his brother, and he wants the Cannons to fight it for him. But Loy is a pragmatist. In fact, the only time he flashes violent here is in defense of his own pragmatism, when Leon suggests killing Gaetano and going to war with the Faddas. He seems to believe that Satchel is dead, but he can’t bring himself to strangle the boy’s Italian counterpart in the bathroom, and he sees some value in simply letting Gaetano go free, sensing that the brute will be more inclined to attack Josto than him. He also offers Swanee and Zelmare two tickets to Philly, which settles their beef over the heist nonviolently and neutralizes yet another threat against the Cannons. Yet there are limits to Loy’s power and success that are out of his control. One small, crucial moment in the episode is when Loy encounters the Diners’ Club billboard on the side of a building. He had an idea that would have not only made him extravagantly wealthy but also given him access to legitimate power, a safe exit from the volatility of the alternate economy. That idea was plucked by white bankers of much higher cultural standing, but much more limited imagination. He can make all the right decisions, but there’s a hard ceiling on how far he can go. “They can’t rise to our level, so they’ve got to drag us down to theirs,” Loy grouses to Odis about the Faddas. “If I get in the dirt like them, it means they were right the whole time.” In an episode that sets Loy and Josto up for comparison, there can be no doubt that Loy is the craftier of the two, with good instincts and a fuller understanding of what power he does and does not have. But that billboard is a reminder that he may be doomed to fail no matter what he does. The Faddas may fumble their way to legitimacy one day. The game is rigged against the Cannons. 3 Cent Stamps "
22,"The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix, Amazon and Stan in Australia in November","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 02:47:06 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/television/best-tv-movies-netflix-stan-amazon-australia.html,Noel Murray,"Every month, streaming services in Australia add a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are our picks for November. The four-part series “Wrong Kind of Black” is based on the experiences of Boori Monty Pryor as a young adult, in the years before he became renowned for using spoken-word performances and children’s books to explain Australian Aboriginal culture to kids. In the 1960s and ’70s, Pryor worked to make his name as a DJ, spinning R&B and disco to audiences who loved the music of Black Americans, but who nevertheless discriminated against Black Australians. Clarence Ryan plays Pryor — and Aaron McGrath his brother Paul — in this lighthearted but pointed social dramedy, set partly in the rowdy urban club scene of 50 years ago. Many movie and TV buffs first got to know the actors James Van Der Beek, Michelle Williams, Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes during the six seasons they spent on “Dawson’s Creek” between 1998 and 2003, playing four friends managing the growing pains of high school and college. Created by Kevin Williamson — a writer unusually attuned to the uncomfortably adult feelings and problems of teenagers — the show balanced the usual young adult romantic melodrama with rich character development, making each of these kids’ dreams and disappointments feel vividly real. When two precocious and nerdy New York teenagers are left at home by their families over Christmas break, they become acquainted at a distance by hiding notes, leaving clues and challenging each other to a series of dares and games around the city. That’s the premise of “Dash & Lily,” a TV series based on a young adult novel by Rachel Cohn and David Levithan. The episodes alternate between the two lead characters, showing that the cynical Dash (Austin Abrams) and the sunnier Lily (Midori Francis) may have similar tastes in literature and music, but remain far apart when it comes to the wonders of the holiday season. On their popular YouTube channel — and podcast, and live shows, and multiple web series — the Australian comedy troupe Aunty Donna have put their own twist on Monty Python-style absurdism. A typical sketch has the teams’s core performing trio (Mark Samual Bonanno, Broden Kelly and Zachary Ruane) sharing an ordinary encounter like a meal or a bit of casual chit-chat, which quickly warps into something dark and strange— or sometimes just gleefully silly. The group will be working on a somewhat larger scale for their six-part Netflix series “Aunty Donna’s Big Ol’ House of Fun,” so it’ll be exciting to see what they come up with when they have more money to spend. One of the more high-profile holiday offerings from Netflix this year, the fantastical musical “Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey” features songs by John Legend, who’s also one of the project’s producers. Written and directed by David E. Talbert, the movie stars Forest Whitaker and Keegan-Michael Key as rival toymakers: one a genius who struggles to make ends meet, and the other rich and unscrupulous. It’s a traditional underdog story, but filled with magical Christmas gadgetry and some warm Yuletide tunes. Two long-awaited major characters enter Queen Elizabeth II’s orbit for the fourth season of the historical drama “The Crown”: Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) and Lady Diana Spencer (Emma Corrin). This time the show will dramatize the late ’70s and early ’80s, a time when Queen Elizabeth (Olivia Colman) dealt with another round of family scandals just as her country suffered from an economic downturn and widespread social unrest. The creator Peter Morgan has been telling these stories in two-season arcs, so these will be the last episodes with Colman as the queen. (May God save her.) Here’s another big new Netflix Christmas musical with a pop powerhouse in the credits. Dolly Parton wrote the songs for “Christmas on the Square” and also plays an angel who tries to persuade a sourpuss landlord (played by the delightful Christine Baranski) not to drive the residents of a quaint, snowy small town out of their homes. Treat Williams and Jenifer Lewis play two of the villain’s oldest friends who also try to get her into the holiday spirit, amidst many colorful song-and-dance numbers. The author and activist J.D. Vance survived a tough childhood in a working class Ohio town, where he was surrounded by poverty and addiction. He later wrote about the experience in the best-selling memoir “Hillbilly Elegy,” which has now been adapted into a movie by the Oscar-winning director Ron Howard and the screenwriter Vanessa Taylor. Gabriel Basso plays Vance, Glenn Close plays the hard-nosed grandmother who taught him the value of work, and Amy Adams plays the mother who was a destabilizing presence in his life. Also arriving: “Felix Lobrecht: Hype” (November 3), “Love & Anarchy” (November 4), “Carmel: Who Killed Maria Marta?” (November 5), “Paranormal” Season 1 (November 5), “The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run” (November 5), “Justice League Dark: Apokolips War” (November 6), “Wrong Kind of Black” Season 1 (November 6), “Satellite Boy” (November 7), “Sweet Country” (November 7), “Toomelah” (November 7), “Goldstone” (November 8), “Undercover” Season 2 (November 9), “What We Wanted” (November 11), “The Life Ahead” (November 13), “The Minions of Midas” (November 13), “We Are the Champions” (November 17), “The Gulf” Season 1 (November 18), “The Princess Switch: Switched Again” (November 19), “If Anything Happens I Love You” (November 20), “Shawn Mendes: I Wonder” (November 23), “The Christmas Chronicles: Part 2” (November 25), “Great Pretender” Season 2 (November 25), “How I Met Your Mother” Seasons 1-10 (November 25), “Mosul” (November 26), “The Call” (November 27), “A Go!

Organized crime these days is an international operation that involves the cooperation of crooks, mercenaries and politicians from all over the world. So despite its name, the mob drama “Gangs of London” doesn’t just stay put in England. This sprawling and stylish series — cocreated by Matt Flannery and “The Raid” director Gareth Evans — is ostensibly about the internal power-struggle that ensues when an old-school syndicate boss gets assassinated. But there’s trouble outside the family too, as gunmen and schemers from across Europe, Asia and Africa jostle for position, in a story with a complex plot interspersed with dynamic and explosively violent action sequences. Science-fiction-inspired comedies have had a bit of a bad run in 2020, with the disappointing “Avenue 5” and the inert “Space Force” letting down fans of their talented creators and casts. But there’s still reason to hope for the best from “Moonbase 8,” a bone-dry sitcom about NASA washouts who’ve agreed to isolate in a desert training facility to prove they’re fit for space travel. The would-be astronauts are played by Fred Armisen, Tim Heidecker and John C. Reilly, who also co-wrote the series with Jonathan Krisel (a fellow master of sublimely odd humor). Ronald Reagan has had a lasting impact on the U.S.A., where politicians still ape his folksy charisma and his nostalgic appeals to the ideals of American individualism. Yet the realities of the Reagan administration — both good and bad — sometimes get lost in the rush to turn him into a symbol. The director Matt Tyrnauer’s four-part docu-series “The Reagans” is intended as a corrective. With the help of insider interviews, Tyrnauer aims to explore the behind-the-scenes debates and personality clashes behind some of the President’s best and worst policy decisions. A lot of nostalgic TV revivals try to replicate not just the premise but also the look and the feel of the originals. The new version of the ’90s teen sitcom “Saved By the Bell” brings back a lot of the original cast, now playing the parents to the latest batch of students at California’s Bayside High. But judging by the early trailers, it has a very different visual style. (Plus, the characters now make self-referential jokes, more in line with a show overseen by “30 Rock” and “Great News” writer Tracey Wigfield.) The series’ goals don’t seem that far off-model though. This “Saved By the Bell” will still use light comedy and soapy drama to tell stories with social relevance. One of the more underrated American TV dramas of the 2010s, the low-key “Rectify,” is about Daniel Holden (Aden Young), a man released from prison after spending nearly 20 years behind bars for a rape and murder he was accused of committing as a teenager. Upon returning to his tiny hometown in the state of Georgia, Daniel tries to win back his neighbors’ trust, while proving that he’s not the villain they presume. Created by the great character actor Ray McKinnon, “Rectify” is a sensitively rendered character sketch about a man struggling to be his best self, in a world he barely recognizes. Also arriving: “Vanity Fair” Season 1 (November 5), “In the Dark” Season 1 (November 6), “The Mighty Ones” (November 10), “Dark Heart” Season 1 (November 12), “The Moodys Christmas” (November 13), “Gordon, Gino & Fred’s Road Trip” Season 1 (November 15), “Trauma” Season 1 (November 17), “Chicken Run” (November 20). Part travelogue, part reality competition and part adorable animal show, “The Pack” features a dozen dogs and their humans, who team up to complete various physical and mental challenges around the world. The U.S. Olympic ski champion Lindsey Vonn hosts and sets the tone with her intro, which emphasizes both the thrill of a grand outdoor adventure and the deep bond between pets and their masters. What results is something a little like “The Amazing Race,” but with cute pooches in tow. The filmmaker Steve McQueen (best-known for the Oscar-winning “12 Years a Slave”) grew up in London at a time when immigrants with West Indian roots were at the center of a raging national debate over England’s growing multiculturalism. McQueen’s anthology series “Small Axe” (co-written with Alastair Siddons and Courttia Newland) tells five different stories, set between the late 1960s and the early ’80s. Each covers aspects of life in the city’s West Indian communities, documenting everything from the vibrant house parties to the persistent clashes with the local constabulary. Each chapter stands alone, but collectively they paint a bigger picture about a moment in time when a country had to reckon with its rapid demographic changes. Also arriving: “Ferro” (November 6), “James May: Oh Cook!” (November 13). "
23,"Aydin Aghdashloo, Under #MeToo Cloud, Faces Art World Repercussions","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 12:16:47 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/world/canada/iran-metoo-aghdashloo-reaction.html,Farnaz Fassihi and Catherine Porter,"A famous and well-connected Iranian artist who has been accused by at least 13 women of sexual misconduct is starting to see signs of repercussions in the art world that once exalted him, both in Iran and Canada, where he has dual citizenship. The artist, Aydin Aghdashloo, whose work has been auctioned and shown around the world, is the most prominent figure to be accused in Iran’s burgeoning #MeToo movement. He has denied wrongdoing and taken legal action against at least one of the women. But their accounts, detailed in an Oct. 22 New York Times article, have been widely shared in Iran and generated more criticism of the artist. Mr. Aghdashloo’s Instagram account appears to have restricted comments since the Times article was published. Through his lawyers, Mr. Aghdashloo has demanded a retraction of the article. The Times is standing by it. A solo exhibition of Mr. Aghdashloo’s work that had been planned for a Saturday opening at the Dastan art gallery in Tehran was canceled by the artist’s representatives in late August, a few days after the first allegation surfaced on Iranian social media, Hormoz Hematian, the founder of the gallery, said this past week. Mr. Hematian also said the gallery has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual misconduct that extends to artists it showcases. Tehran Auction, an important annual venue for Iran’s art where Mr. Aghdashloo’s work is prominently featured every year, said it was considering withdrawal of his two paintings set for showing at the auction tentatively planned for Dec. 11. “I recommended to the team to pull the paintings out,” said Homa Taraji, head of international relations for Tehran Auction. “We do care about these allegations. Including him in the auction is going to create a negative perception about Tehran Auction and affect our work internationally.” A documentary about Mr. Aghdashloo written and directed by his daughter, Tara, is also facing uncertainty. The film was described by the executive producer as part love letter, part confrontation between father and daughter. But the film’s completion predated the allegations of sexual misconduct, said the executive producer, Mahyad Tousi, a Los Angeles-based writer and producer who has mentored Ms. Aghdashloo. “I believe women. Period. Ever since the allegations, my recommendation to Tara has been to find a way to include them,” Mr. Tousi said. If the film is released as is, he said, “I would have to withdraw my name and affiliation with it.” Representatives of Mr. Aghdashloo and his daughter did not respond to emailed requests for comment. Mr. Aghdashloo’s supporters, including some of his former students, have taken to social media to reject the allegations and recount positive memories of their experience in his workshops. On Wednesday, his 80th birthday, they shared photographs of previous parties with Mr. Aghdashloo surrounded by female students and a birthday cake. “I learned great lessons in life and art from you, happy birthday dear teacher,” Sanaz Barzegar, an artist, wrote on her Instagram page with a photo of Mr. Aghdashloo. In Canada, a petition started by a handful of women in August has now garnered more than 800 signatures calling for the hugely popular biannual Iranian-Canadian Tirgan cultural festival, which drew 160,000 people last year, to announce publicly that it will no longer invite Mr. Aghdashloo. The festival’s chief executive and board have remained noncommittal about the accusations. “Our board decided this has nothing to do with Tirgan,” said the chief executive, Mehrdad Ariannejad. “We invite as many artists as we can to our gatherings and performances. Are they going to ask all the organizations, all the museums around the world, all the people that have been in contact with Mr. Aghdashloo to come out and take a position?” In 2017, an interview with Mr. Aghdashloo at the festival was posted to the Tirgan YouTube channel. “I personally, definitely, condemn any violence against women. I’ve always supported women’s rights,” said Mr. Ariannejad, adding that he believed the accounts should be investigated by an independent judicial body before any conclusions are drawn. “You can’t go out and condemn this person,” he said. Mr. Ariannejad also co-owns an art gallery with one of Mr. Aghdashloo’s former wives, Fay Athari, in the trendy Distillery District of Toronto. The Arta Gallery is known as the cultural heart of the city’s small Iranian community, hosting book launches, art shows and lectures. In August, just as public accusations against Mr. Aghdashloo were coming out on Iranian social media, the gallery highlighted Aghdashloo works and publicized art workshops with him over three days, stating, “Are you ready for a workshop with a legend?” The workshops were canceled because of concerns around Covid-19, Mr. Ariannejad said. Found at the gallery, Ms. Athari said she had no comment, other than that she was “disappointed” by the Times article outlining the allegations against her former husband. Though divorced, they are regularly photographed in public together. She posted a photo of herself outside the gallery with him on her private Instagram account on Aug. 26. Mr. Ariannejad said the gallery would not host Mr. Aghdashloo now, in the aftermath of the allegations. “We are not taking a position,” he said. “But we try to avoid the noise.” Hajar Moradi, an Iranian-Canadian artist in Toronto who helped create the petition, said it was impossible for women to get justice in Iran, where they can be criminalized for simply reporting sexual assault, because extramarital relations are illegal. It was in Canada, she said, that she expected some kind of public support for the aggrieved women. “Is it not enough that these women came out with their own names, putting their own pictures on the news and doing interviews in Farsi media as well, saying this happened to me?” Ms. Moradi asked. Referring to Mr. Ariannejad, she said, “Why does he not believe the women?” Other Iranian-Canadian women also criticized Mr. Ariannejad’s refusal to emphatically dissociate the Tirgan festival from Mr. Aghdashloo. “What does it say about him, this is who he works with?” said Safaneh Mohaghegh Neyshabouri, a Canadian-Iranian professor at the University of Calgary who helped create the petition. “I don’t think the Tirgan festival can morally afford to not take a stand. Not taking a stand in this case means the festival is not a safe space for women.” In Iran, the allegations against Mr. Aghdashloo have led to fiery criticism of him on social media, setting off conversations within families about the nature of sexual abuse and the meaning of consent, including in conservative religious households where discussions about sex are ordinarily taboo. Abdulreza Davari, a senior adviser to former President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said he had discussed the subject with his own wife and daughter because of the Times article about Mr. Aghdashloo, which he described as having created “a huge impact on public opinion about Iran’s MeToo movement.” Some Iranian artists and cartoonists have also publicly criticized Mr. Aghdashloo through their work. A sketch by the artist Behzad Kambouzia of Toronto, for example, depicts a female student of Mr. Aghdashloo’s covering a portrait of his face with black marks. A Tehran-based writer and artist, Fazel Torkaman, posted a message on his Instagram account chastising Mr. Aghdashloo’s defenders and saying his accusers deserve to be heard. “Truth has a way of finding its way out, in the long run it will crash down from the sky,” he wrote.

24,"The Best Movies and TV Shows Coming to Amazon, HBO Max, Hulu and More in November","Sun, 01 Nov 2020 22:58:56 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/streaming-hulu-amazon-hbo.html,Noel Murray,"Every month, streaming services add movies and TV shows to its library. Here are our picks for some of November’s most promising new titles. (Note: Streaming services occasionally change schedules without giving notice. For more recommendations on what to stream, sign up for our twice-weekly Watching newsletter here.) ‘Small Axe’ Starts streaming: Nov. 20 The “12 Years a Slave” director Steve McQueen evokes the playwright August Wilson’s “Century Cycle” with his new five-part anthology series, set among London’s West Indian neighborhoods between the late 1960s and the early ’80s. Kicking off with the two-hour movie “Mangrove” — an intense courtroom drama, about the police harassment of a Black Power organization in Notting Hill — “Small Axe” proceeds through four hourlong episodes that capture the characters, the culture and the causes that animated Black immigrants in England during the period when McQueen came of age. As is the case with his theatrical films, these TV episodes (co-written with Alastair Siddons and Courttia Newland) aren’t dully polemical. Instead they plunge viewers into the sounds and sensations of their times, and are brought to life by memorable characters, played in “Small Axe” by the formidable likes of John Boyega and Letitia Wright. Also arriving: Nov. 6 “Ferro” Nov. 13 “Alex Rider” (IMDb TV) “James May: Oh Cook!” Nov. 20 “The Pack” ‘Fireball: Visitors from Darker Worlds’ Starts streaming: Nov. 13 During the past 15 years, the veteran German filmmaker Werner Herzog has collaborated occasionally with Clive Oppenheimer, a British scientist with a particular interest in how forbidding landscapes and strange geological phenomena affect human society. Oppenheimer appeared in Herzog’s “Encounters at the End of the World,” and co-directed “Into the Inferno” with him. In their latest documentary, “Fireball,” these two endlessly curious friends travel the world, looking for meteorite fragments in and around giant craters. As Herzog notes in his typically deadpan narration, he’s less interested in the scientific particulars of these rocks than he is in how they’ve shaped communities across the planet. For centuries, people have created art and have even developed religious observances, based on their encounters with these strange artifacts from the sky. Herzog, Oppenheimer and their interview subjects ponder the meaning of this, considering how something so ancient and so alien might have made us who we are. Also arriving: Nov. 13 “Becoming You” “Doug Unplugs” ‘Industry’ Starts streaming: Nov. 9 If nothing else, it may be worth watching the zingy white-collar melodrama “Industry” for its talented young cast of British and American newcomers, some or all of whom could be stars someday. Even if none of these actors ever break through, this is still a fast-paced and enjoyably soapy take on the modern world of high finance, following a diverse group of interns at a high-powered London investment bank, as they work too much — and party too hard — while trying to impress their superiors enough to get a permanent position. The details of big business are fairly up-to-date, but otherwise this is a timeless story about ambitious youngsters, learning their limits as they race headlong toward a future they’ve been imagining for themselves. ‘Murder on Middle Beach’ Starts streaming: Nov. 15 As a teenager, Madison Hamburg, then an aspiring filmmaker, learned that his mother had been murdered in their upper-middle-class neighborhood in Madison, Conn. — and that his estranged father, a scandal-plagued international wheeler-dealer, was a prime suspect. Years later, as the local police proved ineffective at cracking the case, Hamburg picked up his camera and started interviewing family members and friends, investigating not just the crime but the mysteries of a childhood that seemed privileged and idyllic, but was more troubled behind closed doors. The result of his project is the four-part docu-series “Murder on Middle Beach,” which combines home movie footage with at-times harrowing personal confrontations. This is a different kind of true-crime story, where the endpoint isn’t so much “whodunit” as “Who am I?” ‘The Flight Attendant’ Starts streaming: Nov. 26 “The Big Bang Theory” actress Kaley Cuoco is both an executive producer and the star of the paranoid thriller “The Flight Attendant,” a mini-series adapted from Chris Bohjalian’s novel of the same name. Cuoco plays Cassie, a free-spirited flight attendant who typically spends her layovers in exotic ports of call, getting drunk and sleeping with handsome passengers — that is, until she wakes up one morning in a luxury hotel, in bed with a corpse. The show’s plot is gripping, following Cassie as she tries to scurry back to her life before anyone notices the death. But what makes the series more than just an exercise in Hitchcockian suspense is Cuoco, a gifted comic actress who here shifts her skills to drama without losing her vivacity. Also arriving: Nov. 5 “Two Weeks to Live” Nov. 7 “The Rock ’n’ Roll Hall of Fame 2020 Inductions” Nov. 16 “His Dark Materials” Season 2 Nov. 18 “Crazy, Not Insane” Nov. 21 “Between the World and Me” Nov. 26 “Superintelligence” ‘Eater’s Guide to the World’ Starts streaming: Nov. 11 Before the pandemic changed the nature of food writing, the columnists for the website Eater often focused as much on the overall vibe of the restaurants and bars they covered as they did the food or the chefs — or on how they were going to stay open during the shutdown. The series “Eater’s Guide to the World” was mostly shot pre-Covid; and it is a welcome reminder of how things used to be. Each half-hour episode offers little vignettes from different regions — the Pacific Northwest, Costa Rica, Tijuana and more — that emphasize the décor, the customers and the funky specialties of local hangouts. Much of the show’s appeal is attributable to its narrator, Maya Rudolph, who mixes an occasionally offbeat observation into her otherwise evocative and poetic descriptions, delivered in a cheerily lilting voice. ‘No Man’s Land’ Starts streaming: Nov. 18 This ripped-from-the-headlines action series covers multiple aspects of the ongoing Syrian civil war, shown from the perspective of a Frenchman named Antoine (Félix Moati) as he tries to solve a family mystery. When he sees someone who looks like his dead sister in a news report about Kurdish freedom fighters, Antoine upends his cozy domestic life and heads to the Middle East, where he meets rebels and mercenaries, all while trying to determine if his sister is alive. Though the current Syrian political situation provides the backdrop — with the work of the all-female militia known as the Women’s Protection Units as the show’s specific subject — “No Man’s Land” is mostly about the confusion and the life-and-death frenzy within a war-torn region. ‘Animaniacs’ Starts streaming: Nov. 20 When the original “Animaniacs” series debuted in 1993, the show’s combination of zany irreverence and pop-culture references won over both kids and their parents and helped lead a new wave of smart, creative cartoons. Hulu’s “Animaniacs” revival doesn’t stray too far from what worked the first time. The same core characters — the hyperactive trio of Yakko, Wakko and Dot, plus the would-be world-dominating mice Pinky and the Brain — have third-wall-breaking mini-adventures and sing smart-alecky songs, all in an animation style that hasn’t been tweaked or updated much since the ’90s. Older fans who tune into the new version for a nostalgia rush will find what they’re looking for — and in the first episode will be merrily mocked in song by the Warner brothers (and sister). Also arriving: Nov. 1 “Skins” The Complete Series Nov. 9 “The Mighty Ones” Season 1 Nov. 10 “A Teacher” Nov. 13 “I Am Greta” “Sputnik” Nov. 20 “Run” “Tesla” Nov. 24 “Black Narcissus” "
25,Dispute Over Pissarro Painting Looted by Nazis Is Back in Court,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 13:43:37 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/pissarro-oklahoma-nazi-looters.html,Sarah Bahr,"When Léone Meyer discovered in 2012 that a painting Nazi looters had stolen from her father was in the collection of an American museum, her first instinct was to demand its return. But Ms. Meyer, who lives in Paris, and the Fred Jones Jr. Museum of Art at the University of Oklahoma, struck an agreement in 2016: The 1886 painting, “La Bergère Rentrant des Moutons,” or “Shepherdess Bringing in Sheep,” by Camille Pissarro, would be displayed at a museum in France for five years, then would rotate every three years between the university and one or more French institutions of Ms. Meyer's choosing. Ms. Meyer, who is 80 years old, also agreed that, either during her lifetime or in her will, she would give the painting to an art institution in France. In 2018, Ms. Meyer, a Holocaust survivor who owns the painting, tried to donate it to the Musée d’Orsay, where it has been on display since 2017, for its permanent collection. But the museum refused, telling Ms. Meyer it did not want to assume the cost and risk of transporting the painting to America every three years, which would have been required under the terms of the settlement (Ms. Meyer had insured the painting while it was on temporary display). Ron Soffer, a lawyer for Ms. Meyer, said that any other French institution she offered it to would presumably do the same. Ms. Meyer is now seeking to prevent it from being displayed at the University of Oklahoma, where it is scheduled to return in July. She has also filed a lawsuit in France seeking permanent ownership without any rotation. But the university disagrees that the French museum’s refusal to accept the work — and the possibility that the painting could remain in America indefinitely — is grounds for voiding the original deal. Ms. Meyer “now inexplicably seeks to break” a settlement that “was heralded as a first-of-its-kind U.S.-France international art sharing agreement,” the university’s president, Joseph Harroz, Jr., and the University of Oklahoma Foundation president and chief executive, Guy Patton, said in a statement on Thursday. The university has acknowledged that the painting was stolen by the Nazis from Ms. Meyer’s father, but said in the previous court proceedings that it did not want to return the work because of procedural rules and the statute of limitations. It also produced evidence that the previous owners, the Weitzenhoffer family, who bequeathed it to the university in 2000, having bought it at a New York gallery, had acted in good faith. But Ms. Meyer’s lawyer said a ruling by France’s highest court in July determined that the possessors of stolen art must return the work to the rightful owner free of charge, regardless of how they came to possess it. Mr. Soffer said Ms. Meyer has offered a compromise of a partner exhibit between the university and the Musée d’Orsay, in which the French museum would loan the university other work, such as a painting by Renoir. But the university’s position is that the deal is done. “For all the good faith that the OU Foundation and the University of Oklahoma have extended to Ms. Meyer, it is disappointing that she is actively working to renege on the agreement,” the statement said. “We are ready to challenge this unwarranted threat in U.S. and French courts.” The case is scheduled to be heard by a French court in January.

26,"Nikki McKibbin, ‘American Idol’ Finalist, Dies at 42","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 03:25:17 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/television/nikki-mckibbin-dead.html,Marie Fazio,"Nikki McKibbin, a singer-songwriter from Texas best known for her third-place finish on the inaugural season of “American Idol,” died on Sunday. She was 42. Ms. McKibbin’s death was confirmed by her husband, Craig Sadler, who said on Facebook that she was taken off life support early Sunday morning, four days after she experienced complications from a brain aneurysm. Her son, Tristen Langley, said she died in a hospital in Arlington, Texas. “She was so loved that I know thousands of you will be grieving with us,” Mr. Sadler wrote. Ms. McKibbin rose to national fame in 2002 as a contestant on “American Idol,” the Fox reality show in which singers competed for a record deal. Appearing with an unabashedly punk style, complete with a shock of dyed red hair, she was praised for her soulful covers, including “Total Eclipse of the Heart” by Bonnie Tyler, “Black Velvet” by Alannah Myles and “Piece of My Heart,” which Janis Joplin made famous with Big Brother and the Holding Company. She finished third on the show, behind Kelly Clarkson, the winner, and Justin Guarini. “Nikki McKibbin was an incredible talent and we are deeply saddened by the news of her passing,” a spokeswoman for “American Idol” said in a statement. “She was part of our ‘American Idol’ family and will be truly missed. Our hearts and prayers go out to her family and friends during this difficult time.” A longtime fan of Stevie Nicks, Ms. McKibbin covered her song “Edge of Seventeen” in one of her final performances on the show. During Ms. McKibbin’s time on “American Idol,” Ms. Nicks sent her flowers and a card that read, “You are the Gypsy that I was,” Mr. Guarini said on Instagram. The gesture put Ms. McKibbin “on cloud nine and the joy and excitement that radiated from her was infectious,” he said. Mr. Guarini said Ms. McKibbin “was a fiery, funny lady who could sing the Hell out of a rock song with the same kind of ease and command she lovingly used to cut you with her twangy Southern wit.” Ryan Seacrest, the longtime “American Idol” host, wrote on Twitter that Ms. McKibbin “was a superstar the moment she walked into auditions.” “She set the bar high with her talent and memorable stage presence,” he said. “It was an honor to watch her grow and inspire millions of people.” During Ms. McKibbin’s time on “American Idol,” her son Tristen, who was 4, handed her a rose after a performance. In 2014, Ms. McKibbin accompanied her son, then 15, when he auditioned for the show. As he sang a cover of Sublime’s “Santeria,” she mouthed the words. “We just want the world to know, out of all of the wonderful things she was, the most important thing to us is that she was an extraordinary wife, the most amazing mother a son could ever ask for, and an angel of a grandmother,” Mr. Langley said on Sunday. After “American Idol,” Ms. McKibbin signed a record deal with RCA Records, a division of Sony Music, but clashed with the label when she refused to record a country album, Variety reported. Her debut album, “Unleashed,” was released in 2007 by the Chenoa Music label. Ms. McKibbin’s struggles with substance abuse, including alcohol and cocaine, were chronicled on “Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew” and “Sober House,” both on VH1, Variety reported. She also appeared on “Fear Factor” on NBC, and “Battle of the Network Reality Stars” on Bravo. In addition to her husband and son, Ms. McKibbin is survived by a daughter, Carlie Sadler; her father, Keith McKibbin; a grandmother, Hazel Bunyea; and a granddaughter, Letti Sadler. She was predeceased by her mother, Teresa. Mr. Sadler said on Facebook that his wife was taken off life support in the early hours on Sunday and her organs were donated. Before the operation began, he said, they played “Landslide,” one of Ms. Nicks’s signature songs with Fleetwood Mac, one last time. "
27,Picturing Yourself with Bob Ross as the ‘Experience’ Opens in Indiana,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 16:30:08 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/television/bob-ross-experience-indiana.html,Sarah Bahr,"MUNCIE, Ind. — Lexi Vann was losing her race with Bob Ross. The 19-year-old from Carmel, Ind., sporting a bushy brown Bob wig that defied the stiff Halloween afternoon breeze, dipped her brush into a pool of purple paint and began tracing the outline of a mountain range, taking her cue from an episode of “The Joy of Painting” on a screen set up on the lawn. But Ross, whose curly perm and soothing voice were at odds with his breakneck pace, finished his work, titled “Sunset Aglow,” five minutes ahead of her. “As soon as he started going with the trees, I was lost,” Ms. Vann said, her cheeks flushed. She was among the more than 100 fans of the PBS painter who made the trek — in her case 50 miles, but others came from as far away as Arizona — for the sold-out opening day of the “Bob Ross Experience,” a $1.2 million permanent exhibit and painting workshop series in the city where the beloved television host filmed his show from 1983 to 1994, and inspired generations of fans with his yes-you-can positivity. Their pilgrimage brought them to Ross’s former broadcast studio, painting workshop and temporary art gallery sheltered in a collection of historic buildings that are now part of the Minnetrista museum and gardens. Fans dressed as the painter sampled iced tea — a signature that he sipped between takes — and tried to recreate “Gray Mountain,” a vibrant landscape from 1992, in a workshop led by a certified Ross instructor. Revelers meandered along a winding boulevard in a costume parade, with winners receiving Bob Ross bobbleheads, complete with miniature brush and bucket. “This is fantastic,” Brett Estes, the Best Bob winner said, outfitted in a Bob wig (from a costume shop), beard (real) and light blue button-down. His brushes were tucked in the front pocket. But the crown jewel awaited fans inside Ross’s studio, the former public television station WIPB, inside the Lucius L. Ball House (the family gave the country the iconic glass kitchen jar). Fifteen masked visitors per hour, with timed tickets, could pose with Ross’s easel, palette and the set of brushes he used to create what he called his “happy little trees.” “We made it as close as possible to how it appeared when he filmed here” while still accommodating visitors, George Buss, the vice president of visitor experience at Minnetrista, said. The Experience — offered Wednesday through Sunday — is akin to an Easter egg hunt: Items that belonged to Ross, like the brushes he used on the show, are safely behind acrylic. But everything else is fair game to touch. “We really wanted people to be immersed in the space,” Mr. Buss said. “We have little discoverables everywhere, and we know people will find new things each time they visit.” Ross lovers can slip on a vintage J.C. Penney shirt like the ones he wore on the show, or flip through a stack of his fan mail. And they can pore over shelves full of Ross essentials like a jar of Vicks VapoRub, which he used to clear his sinuses to ensure a smooth, velvety voice, and the hair pick he kept in his back pocket to fluff out his perm. But the ultimate Ross Zen awaits fans in the far corner of the studio, where a painting of a misty mountain rests on an easel, one of some 30,000 (including copies) that the artist boasted of producing in a 1991 interview with The New York Times. (Ross died in 1995, at age 52, of complications from lymphoma; his works — if you can find one — have been offered for up to $55,000 on eBay.) An episode of “The Joy of Painting” plays on the camera monitor — and visitors who step in front of the easel will find themselves standing in Ross’s shoes. The experience can be overwhelming, leaving some visitors in tears. They can also step across the hall into a re-creation of a 1980s American living room, its shelves filled with such memorabilia as a Bob Ross Chia Pet and a Bob Ross toaster. “We wanted to also show Bob as fans watching at home in their living room knew him,” Mr. Buss said. In another building half a mile up the boulevard, a dozen masked people hunched over socially distanced canvases, trying their hand at “Gray Mountain,” in a master class led by Jeremy Rogers, a 21-year-old Ross instructor. (The four workshops offered this weekend were capped at 12 people per class, but Minnetrista plans to offer the three-hour sessions twice a month going forward, for $70 per person.) Mr. Rogers has been certified since 2018 — one of at least 5,000 instructors to complete a three-week training course at the Bob Ross Art Workshop and Gallery in Florida. It offers certification in landscape, floral and wildlife painting and requires that students complete approximately two paintings per day. “It’s pretty intense,” he said, adding that it was the speed demanded of instructors that he found most challenging. Ross completed each painting live on air, with no breaks or cutaways, in 26 minutes and 47 seconds. “To do it as fast as him —” Rogers paused and shook his head. “Man.” He said it takes him about an hour to complete a painting. Doug Hallgren, who has been certified since 2003, managed to match Ross stroke for stroke in a demonstration Saturday on the lawn. The trick, he said, is to embrace “happy little accidents” as Ross called them. “It’s about learning not to go back,” Mr. Hallgren said. “No matter how much you might want to.” Jessica Jenkins, the vice president of collections and storytelling at Minnetrista, said that while critics saddle Ross with a reputation for kitsch, she’s thrilled to finally see him getting the recognition he deserves. The Smithsonian Museum of American History acquired four Bob Ross paintings and a selection of memorabilia last year, and while the museum has not announced its time frame for exhibiting them, the Bob Ross Experience currently displays six of the 26 paintings in the Minnetrista collection. “Lots of people don’t view Bob as a real artist, which is upsetting because he made it simple on purpose for TV,” Ms. Jenkins said. She walked over to a Ross seascape — a gift from Ross’s widow — on the wall in the Ball home. “This is vastly more than what he did on television,” she said. “These are the ones he took his time on; the ones he did for him.” Also on view is an exhibit of 29 Bob Ross paintings that have never been publicly displayed in Oakhurst, a historic Ball home nearby. A majority are loans from Muncie residents, who tell how they acquired the paintings from Ross’s demonstrations in local malls, or as gifts from the painter himself. So how did America’s television painter end up in a college town in the middle of the country? Before the early 1980s, it’s doubtful that Ross, who was born in Florida, could have placed Muncie on a map. But from 1983 until 1994, the painter visited the Midwest city four times a year to tape his show. (He had filmed the first season of “The Joy of Painting” in a Washington, D.C. suburb, but the audio and video quality were poor. Ross, who traveled the Midwest teaching painting workshops, wanted to expand his audience beyond the East Coast. So when he advertised on Muncie’s public television station and his classes sold out, he suspected he had something special on his hands — and struck a deal to film the series here.) And the community has long been invested in preserving his legacy. Minnetrista has been planning the $1.2 million project since 2018. It received a $250,000 grant from the Indiana Tourism Council, as well as support from Bob Ross Inc., the company that owns “The Joy of Painting” and the Bob Ross name, among other patrons. (One of them is Twitch, the streaming service that attracted 5.6 million viewers when it live streamed an all-episode marathon of “The Joy of Painting” in 2015.) Organizers hope to open the second stage of the project, which includes the renovation of the second floor of the L.L. Ball home and the opening of a permanent painting workshop and gallery space there, next fall. Ms. Jenkins acknowledges that the middle of a pandemic may seem like a strange time to kick off an interactive exhibition like this one, but she says everyone could use a dose of Ross’s calm and positivity right now. “My biggest fear in getting into this project was that I’d find out he wasn’t the person I thought he was,” Ms. Jenkins said. “But the Bob Ross you see on TV is completely sincere. He put everyone else first constantly. I was like, ‘Oh, thank God, he was not a jerk.’” "
28,'The Plastic Bag Store' in Times Square Is a Work of Activism and Art,"Mon, 02 Nov 2020 15:51:25 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/theater/plastic-bag-store-times-square.html,Laura Collins-Hughes,"Wrapping around a corner in Times Square, the storefront had been hidden in plain sight since the tail end of winter, when so much of the city’s creative life shut down, locked up and headed home to wait out the coronavirus. The playwright, director and puppet designer Robin Frohardt, best known for a delectable little piece of puppet theater called “The Pigeoning,” had been putting the finishing touches on a new show inside. Part art installation, part immersive puppet play, “The Plastic Bag Store” was meant to open in March, its space tricked out to look like an eco-warrior parody of a well-stocked grocery. Audiences would have been welcome to touch the faux merchandise (brightly colored replicas of fruits and vegetables, bakery items and more, all made from plastic waste), and invited to help arrange the seating at performance time. Puppeteers would have crowded close together to enact Frohardt’s wry dreamscape of a comedy, with shadow puppets to tell the bit that takes place in the ancient past, and bunraku puppets for the parts set in the contemporary world and the far-off future. When the show finally did open, in late October, the installation that Frohardt designed was still the size of a roomy bodega, complete with deli counter and cigarette rack. But the live puppet play had become a beautifully filmed puppet play, and what would have been audiences of 50 had been whittled to a maximum of 12 — masked, socially distanced and so conditioned by the pandemic to be wary about surfaces that they didn’t need to be told not to touch the tantalizing piles of electric-green limes. “We were going to put up signs,” Frohardt said from behind her mask on Thursday morning, near the produce section, “but it has not been an issue.” Developed over four years and timed to coincide with the city’s new plastic bag ban — its enforcement was postponed in March and only implemented in October — “The Plastic Bag Store” is an emphatic work of activism that is also a wistful work of art. Timed tickets are free. The 45-minute film — each act of which is shown on a different screen, in the part of the space where it would have taken place in the live performance — begins with Thad, a lazy young ancient who gets rich selling water in throwaway vases until he realizes the environmental error of his ways. But the warning he tries to leave for posterity, painted on a vase, eludes the 21st-century museum where it is on display. This is where we meet Helen, a history-minded custodian who is forever cleaning up plastic trash, but who is hardly militant; at home, she slips on a pair of Crocs. Disheartened by the greed and shortsightedness of the present, she pens a missive to the future. “Your extreme climate is probably our fault,” she writes, “and the only animals you probably have left to eat are jellyfish and cockroaches.” Then: “Sorry, I ran out of room on the postcard and had to finish this letter on the back of a CVS receipt.” Helen puts her note in a plastic bottle, which is found many years later — after the “robot wars” — near the Equator, fished out of the ice by a man with extravagant eyebrows and fingerless gloves. The object piques in him an enchantingly baffled curiosity about our vanished era and its consumerist ways. The show is only an hour long, but its narrative arc is impressively encompassing. With gorgeous original music by Freddi Price, lighting by Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew and puppeteering by Andy Manjuck, Nick Lehane, Rowan Magee, Admiral Grey and Emma Wiseman, the level of artistry is high. Like “The Pigeoning,” this is puppetry made with adults in mind that is also suitable for children, particularly, in this case, those who are vigilant about climate change. “I don’t really set out to make things all-ages,” said Frohardt, 39, who did theater in high school in Colorado Springs, studied painting at the University of Washington and got into puppetry in the early 2000s in San Francisco after she saw “this Charles Bukowski story about necrophilia, all in puppets, for a grown-up audience.” She thinks of her own work as “not not for kids.” Surprisingly, this version of “The Plastic Bag Store” still manages to be a theatrical experience, with an audience gathered in a darkened space, where the soft hum of the ventilation system is unobtrusively reassuring. Between acts of the film, people whisk in from the wings to change the scenery around us — the kind of transformation I hadn’t witnessed indoors since March, which made it unexpectedly moving. And when the film is done, a live actor (the very funny Tyler Gunther) appears, for the brief but delicious final segment of the show. In its current form, it is not quite what Frohardt envisioned, but it is a highly successful compromise. The impulse to film the puppet play arrived with the shutdown — “I just knew we had to capture it before some other terrible thing happened,” she said — but the result is more cinematic and reflective of her vision than she expected. (Robert Kolodny is the director of photography.) “It’s very much how I saw the show in my head initially,” said Frohardt, who lives in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn. “It doesn’t really feel like a consolation prize to me.” The one thing that’s a little bit painful for her is that the pandemic means she isn’t sharing this moment with all of the people she imagined she would be — including her family in Colorado. “That is the hardest part: not having my parents,” she said, “and not having a room full of my friends, and then having a party at the end to celebrate four years of work. “But I can’t complain,” she added quickly. “I feel so grateful. So many artists lost so many opportunities. I feel lucky that it’s happening at all.” Commissioned by Times Square Arts, “The Plastic Bag Store” inhabits a part of Manhattan enduringly in the glare of electronic billboards, yet ringed by dormant theaters and shuttered restaurants. It’s nowhere near as busy as it used to be. But it’s not deserted, either. It is a rare thing right now to see a show in Times Square. And for once it is actually nice to hear the sounds of traffic bleeding in: signs of life. "
29,Make Some Noise and Move: A Choreographer Provides Instructions,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 17:15:48 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/dance/yanira-castro-last-audience.html,Siobhan Burke,"About 50 people sat in front of their computers on a recent afternoon, banging on pots and pans with kitchen utensils. In a departure from common Zoom etiquette, everyone was unmuted and making as much noise as possible. What began as an attempt to find a synchronized beat quickly unraveled into clanging, joyful chaos. This group activity, based on a choreographic score called “Thunderous Clash,” was an online introduction to a largely offline project, Yanira Castro’s “Last Audience: A Performance Manual.” Before participants left the Zoom event, they received a PDF of the score — basically a set of written instructions — so that they could try it in full on their own. (The complete “Thunderous Clash,” inspired by the form of pot-banging protest known as a cacerolazo, Spanish for casserole, calls for running and shouting with a large group of people, “for a good long time.”) “Last Audience: A Performance Manual” is an effort to maintain the liveness of performance by handing over the instructions for a work’s creation. The manual, to be released in November by the Museum of Contemporary Art Chicago, contains 28 scores from Ms. Castro’s 2019 work “Last Audience,” adapted so that anyone can try them at home. The scores involve everyday movement and household items — no dance training or elaborate materials required. Ms. Castro, 49, a choreographer whose work often blurs the line between performers and spectators, had planned to bring “Last Audience” to MCA Chicago this fall. But as the coronavirus pandemic escalated in the spring, the museum began to rethink its fall programming without in-person gatherings. Rather than canceling or rescheduling the engagement, Tara Aisha Willis, a curator of performance at the museum, invited Ms. Castro to reimagine “Last Audience” in an another format. While many choreographers were adapting to digital spaces, making dance films and Zoom dances, Ms. Castro felt herself pulled in a different direction. “I’ve found watching dance to be really hard online,” she said in a phone interview. “There are times when it has made me cry, because I just want to be there.” For her project, she wanted people to have an experience “really rooted in their bodies.” “I really didn’t want it to be about the screen,” she said. “Last Audience,” which had its premiere last year at New York Live Arts, lends itself naturally to the form of a do-it-yourself manual. It relies on scores that can be written down, functioning as a script or stage directions. And it’s highly participatory, contingent on the active involvement of an audience, while also interested in audience refusal and ambivalence. The process of creating the manual, Ms. Castro said, “in some ways felt like the project becoming more itself.” In the stage version, Ms. Castro and several members of her company, a canary torsi (an anagram of her name), guide participants through a series of scores that change with each performance. (The idea, she said, was to keep the performers “in a place of discovery with the audience.”) When I attended last year, I was asked to join a chorus whispering variations on the phrase “have mercy,” and to illuminate the space around me with a flashlight. The stage teemed with activity, as individuals and groups completed various tasks, or declined to take them on. “It’s energetically a lot to negotiate,” said David Thomson, one of the performer-guides, reflecting on his role in the show. “It’s like having a party. Some people are bored, and you have to be OK with it, and other people are unruly.” For the audience-participants, it was unclear what would happen next, or why; you were just along for the ride. The manual reveals much more, not only the scores themselves, but also some of the thinking behind them. Ms. Castro, who was born in Puerto Rico and lives in Brooklyn, began creating “Last Audience” in response to the 2016 presidential election and what she calls “a real reckoning for the country.” (She also notes how ubiquitous the word “reckoning” has since become.) But until assembling the manual, which includes writing by her and her collaborators — Mr. Thomson, Devynn Emory, Leslie Cuyjet, Pamela Vail and Kathy Couch, who was also instrumental as a designer — she wasn’t explicit about her intentions. “I think many of us in the performance world have this training of not wanting to impede the interpretation, in any way, of the audience,” she said. “That means maybe not speaking to why you made something.” But as she drafted an introduction to the manual, in the tumultuous months before another election, she tried a new approach. “I’m going to do that thing I never do, which is to say: This is why I did this piece,” she recalled thinking. “I’m going to tell you directly why, and it’s about slavery, it’s about genocide, it’s about our common American history.” In the introduction, she writes about her visceral feeling, four years ago, that these violent histories “had been dragged out into the public square, under stadium lighting, and we were all staring at the carcass.” In grappling with this reality, Ms. Castro began researching requiems and Last Judgment imagery. (She describes herself as an atheist fascinated with religion.) The “Last Audience” scores often dictate postures and actions of supplication and prayer, like kneeling and trembling. They fall into five categories, reflected in the titles of the five booklets that make up the full publication: “One Body,” “Sever,” “Judgment,” “Mercy” and “Blessing.” Ms. Willis, the curator who worked closely with Ms. Castro, describes the booklet format as “somewhere between an instruction manual and a prayer book.” While the project takes “an analog approach to the moment,” Ms. Willis said, it also has some digital components. An accompanying website, lastaudience.com, provides video and audio recordings to help with enacting some of the scores. Participants are also asked to document their performances with photographs of the household items or spaces they used — pots and spoons, for instance — and upload them to the website, where they become part of a publicly viewable archive. Anyone who purchases the manual (which is also available as a PDF) is invited to join an online gathering on Dec. 13, around a meal of arroz con gandules (rice and pigeon peas), a Puerto Rican dish that Ms. Castro served before live performances of “Last Audience.” The manual includes a recipe, its own kind of score, so that anyone can make the dish and bring it to the Zoom table. The Chicago-based artist and chef Jorge Felix will join Ms. Castro and members of her company for a conversation about food and other forms of nourishment. The online meal is also a chance for people to discuss their experiences with the scores, even if they have only read them. Ms. Castro said she has no fixed expectations for how people will use the manual. “It’s hopefully a gift that’s like, you can do this if you want,” she said. Some might choose to do the scores in full. But for her, “being present with the page” is also enough, its own kind of live experience. "
30,David Henry Hwang’s ‘M. Butterfly’ Followup: ‘M. Turkey’,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 19:10:25 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/theater/face-value-david-henry-hwang-broadway.html,Alexis Soloski,"David Henry Hwang’s “Face Value” arrived on Broadway on March 9, 1993. It left five days later. For Gina Torres, an actress in that production, the news came as a relief. “Because we were pushing that stone uphill for a good long time,” she said. “Face Value,” Hwang’s follow-up to the Tony Award-winning “M. Butterfly,” was a farce — and not entirely in the ways that Hwang and Jerry Zaks, the play’s director, intended. In 1990, Hwang, the first Asian-American to win a playwriting Tony, joined members of Actor’s Equity in objecting to the casting of Jonathan Pryce as a Eurasian character in the Broadway production of “Miss Saigon.” Equity rejected the casting. When the producer Cameron Mackintosh canceled the production, the union reversed the rejection, stipulating that Pryce could perform provided Asian-American actors were sought as replacements and that Pryce no longer used eye prosthetics or skin darkening bronzer as he had in London. Hwang took the loss as only a playwright can. He went to work on “Face Value,” a comedy of mistaken racial anxiety that modeled on the farces of Michael Frayn and Joe Orton. It centers on a new musical, “The Real Fu Manchu,” and the pair of Asian-American actors, Randall and Linda, who plan to protest it on opening night at the Imperialist Theater. “Fu Manchu” has cast a white actor in the title role and it includes a big number called “He’s Inscrutable,” so there’s a lot to protest. “It’s racist, sexist, imperialist, misogynist — and I didn’t even get an audition,” Randall complains. Set largely backstage, “Face Value” crammed in yellowface, whiteface, gun play, Pirandellian asides, crisscrossing sexual complications and various people hiding in closets. “I remember finishing the first draft and feeling well, this is going to need a lot of development,” Hwang recalled this summer. But the producer Stuart Ostrow signed on immediately. Other producers, including Scott Rudin, soon followed. Zaks assembled a tiptop cast — Mark Linn-Baker as the white actor playing Fu Manchu; Jane Krakowski as a dithery actress; a then-unknown Torres as a put-upon stage manager; Mia Korf as Linda. (BD Wong, who had won a Tony for “M. Butterfly,” later joined as Randall.) Two million dollars were raised. Rehearsals began. “It all came together probably too quickly,” Hwang said. “I was hubristic. I felt like, ‘Oh, I can fix it in four weeks, and then an out-of-town tryout in Boston.’ And I couldn’t.” Torres remembers the first night of the Boston tryout. “Nobody laughed,” she said. Frantic rewriting began, with new lines, new cuts, new scenes arriving nearly every day. “We might have cut intermission at one point,” Torres said, “like we’re going to hit them fast and furious and not give a chance to leave.” It was an exhausting process — physically, emotionally. The play opened on Valentine’s Day to reviews that were less than loving. Hwang recalls one that ran with the headline “M. Turkey.” But “M. Butterfly” also hadn’t done especially well out-of-town. So the producers made a decision to move forward. Torres remembered the excitement of walking by the Cort Theater and seeing her name on the posters. “We thought: ‘Oh, now we’re in New York. We can turn this around because New York has a more diverse audience. They’re waiting for us,’” she said. Hwang began another round of revisions. Decades on, he couldn’t recall exactly what changed. “I’ve probably blocked a lot of that,” he said. But a New York Times article reported a new beginning and a new ending. Somehow these made the play worse. The Boston script, Hwang said, at least had a certain singleness of purpose. The New York one, rewritten in desperation, did not. And it wasn’t any funnier. Torres thinks that has more to do with content than with comedy. “It really made you look at the absurdity of color and how we perceive it in human beings, which is I believe, ultimately what killed us,” she said. She often wonders how it would play today. “Face Value” shuttered after eight previews, with the producers, in a Times article, citing “a lack of box-office interest.” The actors moved on. Torres finally made her Broadway debut a year later with the barely longer lived “The Best Little Whorehouse Goes Public.” (“What it ain’t got is fun,” the Times critic wrote.) It would take another decade for a Broadway show to close during previews, the Farrah Fawcett-starring “Bobbi Boland.” Hwang moved on, too. “I can compartmentalize pretty well,” he said. But the idea of mistaken racial identity continued to nag at it him. He revisited it years later in the Obie-winning “Yellow Face,” a semi-autobiographical comedy that also took on the “Miss Saigon” controversy as well as newer strains of anti-Asian racism. In “Yellow Face,” a character known as DHH mounts a Broadway play called “Face Value.” It flops in this fiction, too. That real-life debacle bruised Hwang’s ego and deflated his boy wonder reputation. It didn’t keep him away from Broadway. He has had five further shows there, plus a 2017 “M. Butterfly” revival. “Having a play close in previews on Broadway would generally be considered one of the worst things that can happen to your career, and it is, but I survived it,” he said. “The worst thing happened to me,” he added. “And I’m still here.” Next in Unopened: Bernstein, Robbins, Sondheim and … Brecht? Almost, but not quite. "
31,"How J Balvin Made His Trippy, Eye-Popping Halloween Concert in Fortnite","Sun, 01 Nov 2020 23:29:46 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/music/j-balvin-fortnite-concert.html,Ben Sisario,"For J Balvin’s big entrance on Saturday night in his concert appearance on the video game Fortnite, the Latin pop star rose through a giant glowing pumpkin, just as he might emerge from the bowels of Madison Square Garden on a lift to meet thousands of screaming fans. Appearing as a green-haired, yellow-suited Frankenstein’s monster, Balvin strutted and vamped across the pumpkin throughout his opening number — “Reggaeton,” a tribute to his musical roots — while light beams flashed against a sepulchral set. It was pure Vegas stagecraft. But at the taping of his appearance in California a week before, there was no pumpkin, no riser and no crowd. Just Balvin, surrounded by LED panels on a darkened soundstage that, with some animation wizardry, allowed the virtual jack-o’-lantern — along with a cast of skeletons and goblins — to be digitally added to the performance, a blurring of reality and fantasy well suited to the game. Balvin’s Halloween-themed appearance was the latest high-profile music event on Fortnite, the hugely popular video game that has taken on a new importance to the entertainment industry during the pandemic. With concerts shut down, musicians have flocked to virtual platforms to reach their fans. A well-timed Fortnite show in April by the rapper Travis Scott — with eye-popping graphics that placed Scott within the game’s digital realm — became a surprise cultural event, drawing nearly 28 million players and offering proof of concept to performers who had suddenly found themselves homebound. Balvin’s 13-song, 38-minute set on Halloween was a lighthearted monster mash in Day-Glo colors that resembled a futuristic translation of “Pee-wee’s Playhouse,” with dancers in costume as ghosts, zombie Cyclopes and jolly animals. All the while, full moons, gravestones and spider webs swirled vividly around them. The process of creating the show, witnessed over three of the event’s four days of rehearsals and taping, was a cross between old-fashioned Hollywood and cutting-edge virtual reality. At a nondescript industrial building in Glendale, Calif., dancers lounged backstage waiting for their cues and members of a production crew a few dozen strong watched from a control room. When not thumping with Balvin’s beats, the soundstage was quiet save the whir of an air purifier. But when the taping started, bright lights danced across the LED screens on the diamond-shaped stage and two walls behind it, while monitors displayed those same scenes enhanced with 3D animation. The concert was being created in “XR,” or extended reality, a blending of real and virtual worlds that allowed Balvin and his dancers’ in-the-flesh performances to be augmented by animated effects. In another scene, Balvin sang “Que Pretendes” while standing on a giant golden skeleton palm, another studio illusion. But he was soon joined by the Puerto Rican star Bad Bunny, who was not present for Balvin’s taping but had filmed his appearance in front of a green screen — a glimpse of humanity that was actually another wraith. (The Black Eyed Peas were another virtual guest, for the song “Ritmo.”) Balvin, a 35-year-old star from Colombia, marries sweet and mellow vocals to block-rocking beats, and he has come to epitomize a new kind of global pop, appealing to wide audiences while sticking steadfastly to his native Spanish. He has collaborated with Beyoncé and Cardi B, and Balvin’s Coachella set last year gave a taste of the aesthetic he would bring to Fortnite: dancers in bulbous costumes bounded around him while giant screens showed smiling, brightly colored anime clouds. (His latest album, released in March, is called “Colores.”) The creative team behind Balvin for Coachella and Fortnite, Antony Ginandjar and Ashley Evans of The Squared Division, also choreographed Britney Spears’s Las Vegas show, “Piece of Me.” Besides Scott, other Fortnite concerts have featured Marshmello, the D.J. who wears cartoonish headgear; the producer Diplo; the rapper and singer Dominic Fike; and the K-pop sensations BTS. In a phone interview before his second day of rehearsal, Balvin said he had big ambitions for the set, his first virtual performance of the pandemic. “I really wanted to be the first Latino to make this statement,” Balvin said. “Elevate the culture, elevate the reggaeton movement and elevate my brand as J Balvin, with such amazing technology.” Fortnite concerts take place within the realm of the game, with players’ avatars visible onscreen as they watch the show taking place in front of them, like viewers of a drive-in movie. That layering of realities can be both disorienting and exhilarating. While I watched Balvin’s performance, I kept an eye on my own dancing avatar and occasionally tracked other characters zipping across my field of vision. Fake crowd noises were piped in throughout the show. Balvin, who described his own Fortnite gaming habits as voyeuristic — “I basically just look around, check the vibe” — said he prepared for his performance by imagining himself inside Fortnite’s world. “You’re approaching human beings, of course, but they are in a gamer position; they have their controller in their hands,” he said. “For a lot of people it’s going to be their first reggaeton concert ever, and it’s going to be through Fortnite, so I have to give it all.” Throughout the pandemic, musicians — and tech companies — have scrambled to find the best platforms to stream concerts as the live music industry has come to a halt, abruptly shutting off many artists’ most important revenue stream. Instagram, YouTube and the gaming site Twitch have been crowded with performances, and a host of companies have attempted to charge money for virtual tickets and recreate some elements of attending in-person shows, like preferred seats and artist meet-and-greets. While many livestreams began barely above DIY-level production quality, innovations have emerged: Erykah Badu’s series of shows featured a performance seemingly from inside giant bubbles; a summer festival took place in Minecraft, another game with a gigantic audience. Fortnite has come to be seen as an unusual but promising outlet. It has 350 million users, according to Epic Games, the publisher behind the title, who remain deeply engaged as they play. The company has devoted substantial resources to the concerts, attempting to make each one a special event. “Fortnite has become more than a game,” said Nate Nanzer, the company’s head of global partnerships. Epic says it licenses music and pays the artists a fee for their appearances. Balvin’s show, like all the game’s performances, took place in Party Royale, a combat-free zone within Fortnite’s virtual world. After heading there, players briefly roam through what look like music festival grounds — passing open fields, a fast-food restaurant and a lot of signage — and eventually make their way to the stage. Since the event with Scott, in which a 3D version of the rapper was integrated into the game, the musical appearances on Fortnite (by BTS, Diplo and others) have been taped in real life and displayed within the game, as if through a window between worlds, drawing some fan complaints that the viewing experience was simply not as engaging. Time and production resources are part of the reason, as Epic has tried to put on shows more frequently. “What we’re looking to do is create something that is a little more scalable and repeatable,” Nanzer said. In some ways, the scene in Glendale was like any film production during the pandemic. Everyone on set was given a rapid Covid-19 test. When Balvin arrived for the first day of rehearsal he wore a Lakers hat, a jeans jacket and, like everyone else, a mask. (Over the summer, Balvin came down with a case of Covid-19, and said he was nearly hospitalized. “It’s not a game,” he said of the virus.) But the set had far more advanced technology than any standard music-video shoot. While Balvin and his dancers performed, images moved around them on the stage and walls, sometimes offering the naked eye only a partial glimpse of the ultimate shot. Animators in the control room, and working in postproduction, filled in the 3D scenery and Halloween creatures. On the soundstage, three infrared-equipped cameras performed their own choreography around Balvin. They work by triangulating their positions against hundreds of tiny markers on the walls and ceiling. Each time the director, Shelby Cude, changed a shot, the floors and walls automatically realigned their display to the cameras’ new perspective. “Every time the camera changes, it’s like, Where am I?” said Rudy Garcia, a stand-in for Balvin during rehearsals. Balvin eventually got the hang of it. Practicing how he would appear on top of the pumpkin, he stood several feet from the edge of the stage but pretended to teeter, and almost topple, over what would be the edge of the glowing squash. “I love it!” Balvin said afterward. “It’s crazy. I feel like I’m in the game. Like I’m in Fortnite.” "
32,Dwight Garner Shares From His Stash of Other Writers’ Words,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 10:00:04 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/books/review/dwight-garner-garners-quotations.html,Dwight Garner," For nearly four decades, I’ve kept what’s known as a commonplace book. It’s where I write down favorite sentences from novels, stories, poems and songs, from plays and movies, from overheard conversations. Lines that made me sit up in my seat; lines that jolted me awake. About once a year, I’ll say something I think is worthy of inclusion. I mostly end up deleting those entries. I began keeping my commonplace book in the 1980s, when I was in high school. In the 1990s, when I was working as the arts editor for an alternative weekly newspaper in Vermont, I typed the whole thing into a long computer file. I’ve moved it from desktops to laptops and now onto my iPhone, too. Into it I’ve poured verbal delicacies, “the blast of a trumpet,” as Emerson put it, and bits of scavenged wisdom from my life as a reader. Yea, for I am an underliner, a destroyer of books, and maybe you are, too. Commonplace books are not so uncommon. Virginia Woolf kept one. So did Samuel Johnson. W. H. Auden published his, as did the poet J. D. McClatchy. E. M. Forster’s was issued after his death. The novelist David Markson wrote terse and enveloping novels that resembled commonplace books; they were bird’s nests of facts threaded with the author’s own subtle interjections. For fans of the genre, many prize examples have come from lesser-known figures such as Geoffrey Madan and Samuel Rogers, both English, who issued commonplace books that are notably generous and witty and illuminating. These have become cult items. The literary critic Christopher Ricks said about Rogers that, although he may not have been a kind man, “he was very good at hearing what was said.” In my commonplace book, for handy reference, I keep things in categories: “food,” “conversation,” “social class,” “travel,” “politics,” “cleanliness,” “war,” “money,” “clothing,” etc. I use it as an aide-mémoire, a kind of external hard drive. It helps me ward off what Christopher Hitchens, quoting a friend, called CRAFT (Can’t Remember a F— Thing) syndrome. I use my gleanings in my own writing. Like Montaigne, I quote others only “in order to better express myself.” Montaigne compared quoting well to arranging other people’s flowers. Sometimes, I sense, I quote too often in the reviews I write for The New York Times, swinging on quotations as if from vine to vine. It’s one of the curses of spending a lifetime as a word-eater, and of retaining a reliable memory. I am no special fan of most books of quotations. “Bartlett’s Familiar Quotations,” “The Yale Book of Quotations” and “The New Penguin Dictionary of Modern Quotations,” to name three dependable reference books, are invaluable, for sure, as repositories of literary and verbal history. (Countless other books of quotations aren’t reliable at all, and the less said about quotation sites on the internet the better.) But even the best include a good deal of dead weight. They lean, sometimes necessarily, on canned and overused thought and, grievously, are skewed to the upbeat. So many of the lines they contain seem to vie to be stitched onto throw pillows or ladled, like soup, over the credulous soul. “Almost all poetry is a failure,” Charles Bukowski is said to have contended, “because it sounds like somebody saying, Look, I have written a poem.” The same is true of quotations and aphorisms. So many have a taxidermied air, as if they were self-consciously aimed at posterity. My book, “Garner’s Quotations,” is an attempt to break with the conventions of commonplace books and volumes of quotations. For one thing, it contains only a small selection of the material I’ve hoarded. For another, in arranging these sentences I’ve gone by feel, not by category. I’ve tried to let the comments speak to one another and perhaps throw off unexpected sparks. Quotations, by definition, are out of context. I’ve played freely with this notion and have placed some lines quite out of context indeed. In this book there are few life lessons and little uplift, except by accident. I’ve selected lines mostly from books and writers I admire, and it’s my hope that a reading list might present itself over the course of the proceedings. This book is a way of saying thank you to many writers for the pleasure they’ve brought me. Obviously I don’t agree with everything said; retweet does not always, as they say on Twitter, equal endorsement. A literary critic thinks long and hard before bringing another book into the world. Perhaps, this critic thinks, a thrifty book that points the way to other books might be worthwhile. Writing in the April 1904 issue of The Atlantic, Walt Whitman declared that he was tired of “gloved gentleman words.” He admired “unhemmed latitude, coarseness, directness, live epithets, expletives, words of opprobrium, resistance.” I have tried to put Whitman’s words to use in regard to quotations. There is more blaspheming in this book than there is in most collections of quotations. (Until fairly recently, most did not permit profanity.) It is a truth universally acknowledged among book critics that the most memorable lines in many novels contain the word f—. These cannot be printed in newspapers. I have saved these lines up, and present some of them in this book. "
33,She’s Moved From the Upper East Side to ‘Cobble Hill’,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 09:00:11 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/books/cecily-von-ziegesar-cobble-hill-gossip-girl.html,Alisha Haridasani Gupta,"The inspiration for Cecily von Ziegesar’s latest novel? Lice. About eight years ago, when her two children were in elementary school in Brooklyn, she couldn’t shake the idea that their hair, and her own, were infested with the bloodsucking insects. “I would go down to the nurse and be like, ‘Can you check my head?’ I was combing my kids’ hair every single night,” von Ziegesar said in an interview. “I heard that if you put mayonnaise on your head and wrapped it in Saran Wrap, that would drown them, so I was doing that to my hair every day.” A similar lice encounter kicks off her book, “Cobble Hill,” which Atria publishes on Nov. 10, except that instead of a mother of two having a meltdown, it is Stuart Little, a has-been rock star whose wife, Mandy, it is soon revealed, has faked multiple sclerosis so that she can stay in bed and shirk her parental duties of school drop-offs and paying taxes. If that behavior sounds maniacally self-centered, it’s the kind of character that von Ziegesar, the author of the best-selling young adult series “Gossip Girl,” specializes in — and defends when necessary. “I love Mandy,” she said, a hint of protectiveness in her voice. “I admire her for having the guts to just be, like, ‘This is what I need to do right now.’” Call it guts or selfishness or gutsy selfishness, those traits can be found in most of her female characters, von Ziegesar noted, from the scheming Blair Waldorf and the backstabbers who surrounded her in “Gossip Girl” to the four female characters of “Cobble Hill.” In addition to Mandy, there is a British expatriate working at a Condé Nast-esque magazine, a high school nurse with a crush on a student’s parent and an evasive artist. “I didn’t want them to be characters that you love to hate,” von Ziegesar said. Those women and their families feel like characters that teenage fans of “Gossip Girl” might have graduated to. After all, since her first book came out in 2002 and the television adaptation began airing in 2007, those fans are now reaching prime adulthood, considering career shifts, buying homes and trading their youthful insecurities for more grown-up ones. That might include, as is the case with these characters, giving up on passions for unfulfilling careers that pay the bills, landing jobs they don’t know how to do but pretend to or learning that maybe they don’t love their spouses as much as they used to — all while agonizing over how other people perceive them. “I couldn’t write the ‘Gossip Girl’ books now, but I couldn’t have written ‘Cobble Hill’ then,” von Ziegesar, 50, said. “Hopefully I’ve progressed as a writer.” She herself is a product of the Upper East Side world where “Gossip Girl” is set: Though she grew up on the Upper West Side, she went to school there and had the “funny little experiences of being able to walk around the corner from school and go to my friend’s house,” she recalled. “And I had a few friends whose parents were a little reluctant to let them come over to my house.” The idea for “Gossip Girl” emerged when von Ziegesar was an editor at the book-packaging company Alloy Entertainment, now a division of Warner Bros. Television Group. At the time, the young adult book market was full of series like “Sweet Valley High” that featured made-up locations. “That was so weird to me,” she said. “Why not write about a real place? It just so happened that the real place that I knew was the Upper East Side.” Precise sales figures of the “Gossip Girl” books are hard to come by because the first of the series arrived before tracking was made available, but some estimates suggest it has sold over 4 million copies. The TV series ran for six seasons and helped make celebrities out of cast members such as Blake Lively, Leighton Meester, Penn Badgley and Ed Westwick. An HBO Max reboot is now in the works. In 2002, when von Ziegesar’s debut book came out, she had her first child. By the time the TV series was coming to an end in 2012, she had two children who were old enough to be hooked. “We would watch the show together as a family,” she said from the recently vacated room of her daughter, who is starting her first year at college. “I remember putting my son to bed and he was like, ‘I don’t think I can go to sleep,’ and I asked why not, and he’s like, ‘I’m so worried about Chuck.’” The voyeuristic lens von Ziegesar applied to old-money Upper East Siders, exploring the tension between their nervous inner lives and perfect outward appearances, is what she sought to bring to “Cobble Hill,” which is named for the expensive Brooklyn neighborhood where she and the characters live. Except this book is more relatable, more normal: Instead of elbowing their way into Ivy League schools or throwing parties on Park Avenue, these characters are trying to find babysitters so they can go out for a drunken night of karaoke. “It was ballsy and real,” the literary agent and author Bill Clegg said in an email. He worked with von Ziegesar with edits and feedback on her manuscript but said he didn’t need to do much. “I think I just asked for it to be longer,” he added. (Mandy, it turns out, is also his favorite character.) Von Ziegesar has published several books since the last “Gossip Girl” installment, including “Cum Laude,” about students at a small college in Maine, and “It Girl,” a “Gossip Girl” spinoff whose cover model was a young Hope Hicks, now one of President Trump’s advisers. Though they used the same formula of delving into the trials and tribulations of adolescence, they didn’t have the impact of “Gossip Girl.” “Cobble Hill” is a greater departure for von Ziegesar. And, she mentioned, there are already early whispers of potentially turning it into a TV series as well. In the years she worked on the book, von Ziegesar — who admitted her writing process has never been neat or methodical — continued to jot down flashes of inspiration, ideas and real life events on Post-it notes that she’d stick around her house. “Unlike ‘Gossip Girl,’ where I was writing a series and there were two a year, this really is like a culmination of so many things,” she said. “I was working on it very sporadically for a long time.” This year, as von Ziegesar was cleaning out one of her closets, she found a box of old Post-its. “I looked up and said to my husband, ‘Oh my god, it all went in the book,’” she said. "
34,"On ‘S.N.L.’, Jim Carrey Reads a Spooky Election Update of ‘The Raven’","Sun, 01 Nov 2020 17:51:42 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/arts/television/snl-john-mulaney-jim-carrey-strokes.html,Dave Itzkoff,"On a Halloween night that fell on a fraught weekend before Election Day, a nation turned its lonely eyes to John Mulaney, the “Saturday Night Live” alum whose return appearances to this sketch show are usually a good omen. With no more presidential debates to lampoon, “S.N.L.” opened its latest broadcast with Jim Carrey, in his recurring role as Joe Biden, reading a parody of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Raven,” updating the poem for the 2020 presidential race. Noting that it was Halloween (“For some Trump voters, it’s the only day they’ll wear a mask,” Carrey said), he observed that Election Day was approaching and that many Americans were “very, very, very worried about the outcome.” Carrey continued: “But don’t worry; they say I’m eight points ahead. Poll numbers like that can only go wrong once in a blue moon.” Then he looked out his window and observed that there was, in fact, a blue moon. “That’s a little troubling,” he said. Then, after discarding a copy of “Triggered” by Donald Trump Jr. (which he said was “a little too scary”), Carrey began to read from what he said was a volume by Poe: Into the room came Kate McKinnon, playing Hillary Clinton. Carrey resumed: “We lost before,” McKinnon said. Carrey’s Biden said to her: “But this time is different, I can win. The people know I have a plan.” McKinnon responded, “But your real advantage is you’re not a woman, you’re a man.” Carrey endured further visits from the polling analyst Nate Silver (Mikey Day), Mitch McConnell (Beck Bennett) and the rappers Ice Cube (Kenan Thompson) and Lil Wayne (Chris Redd), who have offered their support to President Trump. Carrey’s last visitor was Maya Rudolph in her recurring role as Kamala Harris. Alternating lines, they delivered a final verse: Mulaney, who was hosting “S.N.L.” for the fourth time (alongside the New York-based musical guest the Strokes, who were also appearing on the show for the fourth time), used his opening monologue to riff about how New York had stayed resilient through the coronavirus pandemic. As a comedian, he said, he belonged to the group of “last responders.” Although he has been heartened to see New Yorkers wearing masks, he said, he was a little sad “because it prevents you from overhearing conversations on the street, and that is one of this city’s greatest joys.” He told a story of walking downtown in December and hearing another pedestrian say on his cellphone: “No, no, no, I can’t meet right now. I’m way uptown.” Mulaney added, “And then he looked at me, and he winked and he kept walking.” Following the election, Mulaney said: “We might have the same elderly man or we might have a new elderly man. Just rest assured, no matter what happens, nothing much will change in the United States. The rich will continue to prosper while the poor languish. Families will be upended by mental illness and drug addiction. Jane Lynch will continue to book lots of projects, and when she does, she’ll deliver. She’s so good at being on TV.” Mulaney also wondered whether his 94-year-old grandmother should be allowed to vote (“You don’t get to order for the table when you’re about to leave the restaurant”), then chided himself for being ageist. “That would be like calling yourself the Greatest Generation,” he said. “ ‘Oh, we fought the Nazis.’ Well, we’re trying to fight the new Nazis if you’d get out of the way and stop voting for people you saw in between coin-collector commercials.” At the Weekend Update desk, the anchors Colin Jost and Michael Che riffed on President Trump’s closing message in the days before the election. Jost began: He asked viewers not to worry because “the president isn’t trying to kill his supporters; he’s actually succeeding at killing his supporters.” According to a study, he went on: Che picked up on the riff with details about the rapper Lil Wayne’s recent meeting with Trump to discuss the president’s Platinum Plan, or as Che described it, “Trump’s FUBU platinum plan for the Black community.” (“I don’t know what it’s actually called,” he added.) Che continued: Because this was an episode hosted by John Mulaney, that dictated that there must also be another entry in his continuing series of musical sketches set in emblematic New York storefronts. This latest segment took place in a Times Square souvenir shop whose proprietor was played by Mulaney and whose customers included Redd and Pete Davidson. When Davidson contemplated buying a well-worn pair of underwear briefs bearing the “I ♥ NY” logo, it triggered a series of musical numbers performed by the cast, including parodies of “Luck Be a Lady” (“Mascots Be Shady Tonight”) and “Hey Big Spender” (“Super Spreader”). Dressed as the Statue of Liberty, Maya Rudolph sang a rousing rendition of “I’m Still Here,” with lyrics that went: “Stepped over bodies drawn in chalk / I knew Son of Sam, the dog could talk / I do the marathon, but I walk / And I’m here.” Set to an irresistible R&B groove, “Strollin’” is a topical tune featuring Thompson, Redd, Ego Nwodim and Punkie Johnson as four Black voters who seem blissfully calm as they get ready to participate in the election (As Redd sings: “Been hoping for so long, for November 3rd / It’s time to march on down, get our voices heard”) — only to find that every polling station they visit has been shut down. The quartet endures closed roads, muscle cramps and a walk along a busy highway before arriving at a polling station with a three-hour-long line. Will they successfully cast their votes? The results may or may not surprise you! "

36,Sean Connery: From Tentative Secret Agent to Suave Bond,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 02:02:33 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/movies/sean-connery-james-bond.html,Thomas Vinciguerra,"In 1965, at the height of James Bond mania, Sean Connery told Playboy magazine that he had no problem with another actor assuming his signature role. “Actually, I’d find it interesting to see what someone else does with it,” he said. “Lots of people could play him.” Strictly speaking, he was right. But by public reckoning, he couldn’t have been more wrong. In the popular imagination, the Scottish-born Thomas Sean Connery, who died Saturday at 90, will always be both the first and the best “Bond … James Bond.” It’s hard to believe that before Eon Productions perfected its Bond formula, the secret agent’s creator, Ian Fleming, gushed about perhaps casting Richard Burton or David Niven as 007. The former would have brought the necessary guts, the latter the requisite charm. But for an enduring, vodka martini-soaked franchise built on one man’s tightly wound toughness, womanizing charisma, tongue-in-cheek one-liners and exquisite tastes, Connery was the Fleming word made cinematic flesh. Critics and superfans endlessly argue the merits of the various Bonds. Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig and even the one-time George Lazenby all have their respective strengths. Inevitably, they bow to the archetypal Connery. His appeal, wrote John Cork and Bruce Scivally in “James Bond: The Legacy,” “comes not just from good looks, it comes from a particular confidence, a certainty within himself.” They added that he had “a natural, authoritative grace, which was at once seductive and intimidating.” Connery was not originally made of such stuff. He had done solid work in “Darby O’Gill and the Little People” (1959) and, briefly, “The Longest Day” (1962), playing a British Tommy. However, when it came to personifying the ultrasophisticated lodestar of Her Majesty’s Secret Service, he was still “a pretty rough diamond,” as the production designer Ken Adam put it. Born in the Edinburgh slums, Connery was full of raw material. The producer Albert Broccoli called him “ballsy”; his partner, Harry Saltzman, said that the man moved “like a big jungle cat.” Bond buffs credit the director of his early films, the Cambridge-educated Terence Young, for rounding Connery into shape. Though neither muscleman nor indiscriminate lover, Young (a.k.a. the “Bond Vivant”) had a taste for high living, big spending, bonhomie and forthrightness. “He was completely ruthless in a gentlemanly sort of way,” said the stuntman George Leech. Connery’s start as Bond was a tad tentative. In the initial 007 outing, “Dr. No” (1962), his boss, M. (Bernard Lee), asks, “Does ‘toppling’ mean anything to you?” Connery answers diffidently: “A little. It’s throwing the gyroscopic controls of a guided missile off balance with a … a radio beam or something, isn’t it?” He even screws up his eyes briefly, trying to recall what the term means. When he dallies with M.’s secretary, Miss Moneypenny (Lois Maxwell), his flirting is a bit too studied. Connery improves in “From Russia With Love” (1963). Outwitted by the covert SPECTRE operative Red Grant (Robert Shaw), he sheepishly admits missing a vital clue to his enemy’s identity. “Red wine with fish,” Connery says with a sigh. “Well, that should have told me something.” But within minutes he stabs and garrotes Grant in what Bond fans have called one of cinema’s most brutal family-friendly fights ever. A sweating Connery then adjusts his tie and retrieves a few trinkets, including stolen money from the corpse. The punchline: “You won’t be needing this … old man.” By “Goldfinger” (1964), Connery and the Bond persona have melded seamlessly in the outsize blueprint for all future classic Bond productions. In the short teaser, our hero blows up a heroin plant with plastic explosives, shucks his scuba suit to reveal a white dinner jacket (with red boutonniere), seduces a traitorous tarantella dancer in her bathtub and, after savage fisticuffs, electrocutes a would-be assassin by knocking him and a space heater into said tub. Connery utters fewer than 75 words in about four and a half minutes. But the last three (“Shocking … positively shocking,” said with soft reprobation as the assassin slowly simmers), combined with Connery’s self-assured sexuality and knockabout confidence, release a loud laugh from moviegoers and get them hooked. So second nature is the persona that when the heroin plant explodes, the man who invariably saves the world reacts merely with an expression of bored, silent amusement and removes his just-lit cigarette from his mouth. Hence Tom Jones, as Bondish a title singer as you can get, could warble in the 1965 outing, “He always runs while others walk / He acts while other men just talk / He looks at this world and wants it all / So he strikes like Thunderball!” Connery didn’t want to continue to strike like thunder or, for that matter, lightning. Also, he wasn’t crazy about swimming with live sharks. The Bond films, he said, “don’t tax one as an actor. All one really needs is the constitution of a rugby player to get through 18 weeks of swimming, slugging and necking.” After the release of “Thunderball” he griped, “What is needed now is a change of course, more attention to character and better dialogue.” The dialogue in what he thought was his last Bond film, “You Only Live Twice” (1967), was just fine. “I like sake … especially when it’s served at the correct temperature, 98.4 degrees Fahrenheit, like this is.” But character got short shrift. Stuffed with sumo wrestling; trap doors; an autogiro equipped with flamethrowers and missiles; a piranha pool; and, of course, a rocket base hidden inside a volcano, “You Only Live Twice” wasn’t exactly an actor’s breakthrough. By this time, Connery’s boredom and even annoyance were obvious. And so he famously quit the series. Except for “The Molly Maguires” (1970), his next few films were unremarkable. Things weren’t going exactly as the freed agent had expected. So for $1.25 million, 10 percent of the gross, and financing for two films of Connery’s choice, Eon lured him back for “Diamonds Are Forever.” Grayer, wiser and somewhat heavier, Connery nonetheless seems to enjoy himself in this bit of 1971 nonsense, reconciled to his increasingly cartoonish legacy. Stuffing a deadly cassette tape into a startled Jill St. John’s bikini bottom, he quips, “Your problems are all behind you now.” One of the screenwriters, Tom Mankiewicz, said, “There was an old pro’s grace about him.” A dozen years later he returned yet again, to the non-Eon production “Never Say Never Again.” It was a pallid remake of “Thunderball.” But, Steven Jay Rubin wrote in “The James Bond Movie Encyclopedia,” “When he’s onscreen, the movie works. Fortunately, he’s onscreen a lot.” Connery once described the part that has now made him immortal as “a cross, a privilege, a joke, a challenge. And as bloody intrusive as a nightmare.” But for those who cannot get enough beluga caviar or Walther PPKs, it remains a dream. Sean Connery as James Bond is forever. "

For Dorothy Parvaz, a radio editor in Washington, D.C., foreign radio was her first introduction to the world beyond Tehran, where she lived until 12. “Listening to radio signals coming in from other countries was just like seeing the world in a way we couldn’t on TV, ” she said. “If I wanted to find music, I went to the apartment downstairs, where one of the kids always got a good signal somehow.

38,How to Make D.I.Y. Worry Dolls,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 01:22:15 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/at-home/activity-worry-dolls.html,Christy Harmon,"There’s a lot to worry about these days. With Covid-19 cases rising, the new darkness of standard time and the election taking place in a few days, everyone could use an extra outlet to release some anxiety. It’s the perfect week to turn your newspaper into a handful of worry dolls. Worry dolls, or muñecas quitapena, originated in the highlands of Guatemala, and legend has it that if you whisper your worries to these tiny dolls before bed and put them under your pillow, your worries will be gone when you wake up. They are traditionally made out of wood or wire and decorated with fabric and other materials. It’s easy to make your own version of these humble tiny dolls with a little bit of newspaper and a few things from around the house. Keep them safe in a homemade envelope or a small bag. Who knows, you may even sleep a little more soundly getting all those extra worries out before bed. What you’ll need: Step 1 Cut about a two-inch wide strip from the newspaper, from the bottom of the page up to the center fold. Cut off one-third of the strip you just made, then cut that horizontally into two long rectangular pieces. You should now have three small pieces of newspaper. This is what you’ll use to make two worry dolls. Step 2 Using the toothpick, roll the largest piece of paper up tightly around it (but not so tight you can’t pull it out). Put a small amount of glue along the end and finish rolling. Gently take out the toothpick and cut the paper cylinder in half. These will be the two body pieces. Step 3 Follow the same steps of rolling and gluing the two smaller pieces of newspaper. These will be the arms. You should now have four small newspaper rolls all together. Step 4 Using the toothpick, make an indentation on both of the larger “body” newspaper rolls one-third of the way from the top. Put a small dot of glue in the indentation and place one of the smaller “arms” on top of the glue, perpendicular to the body and push down gently. Step 5 Crumple up a tiny piece of scrap newspaper and glue to the top and let it dry. Once set, trim the arms a bit shorter so you have a lowercase “t” shape. You now have the base for two worry dolls. Step 6 Now it’s time to decorate! Use a marker to color the hair, face, arms and body of each doll. The head and arms should be one color, and the lower body part another color. Make sure to switch up the colors so your dolls are each unique. Step 7 With your embroidery thread or string, wrap an “x” shape around the arms and body, leaving a tail piece unwrapped. Continue wrapping around the arms and body until the newspaper underneath is covered. Step 8 Tie the thread in a knot with the tail piece, trim excess thread, and poke the strings under with the toothpick to hide the ends. "
39,Kids’ Graphic Novels That Turn the Superhero Genre on Its Head,"Sun, 01 Nov 2020 01:22:13 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/books/review/mister-invincible-pascal-jousselin.html,Gene Luen Yang,"When I was a kid, my local comic shop was in a strip mall about 10 minutes away from my home. It was one of my favorite places in the world. For 60 cents, I could buy a comic book — a ticket to a universe populated by modern-day gods. These days, the modern-day gods of my youth are more ubiquitous than ever. Superheroes are on our T-shirts, in our toy bins and on all our screens. Graphic novels (i.e., thick comic books) are similarly ubiquitous. During the first week of September 2020, the latest volume of Dav Pilkey’s “Dog Man” outsold every other book of any kind in America. In all their success, superheroes and graphic novels seem to have left in the dust local comic shops and the monthly comics they sell. These two graphic novels may illuminate the path forward. PRIMER (DC Comics, 160 pp., $9.99; ages 8 to 12), written by Jennifer Muro and Thomas Krajewski and illustrated by Gretel Lusky, is a spirited new offering from DC Comics, one of America’s oldest comics publishers. Its young protagonist, Ashley Rayburn, lives in the same reality as Wonder Woman, Superman and Batman. Ashley has superpowers that she accesses through a set of high-tech body paints. Different colors give her different powers. Red increases her strength. Purple makes her invulnerable. With yellow, she can shoot fireballs from her fingers. Much of Ashley’s story feels familiar. It begins with her bouncing from one foster home to another, an echo of Billy Batson, the alter ego of Shazam. Like Raven of the Teen Titans, Ashley has a villainous father. During battles, Ashley is as devastating with her quips as Spider-Man. But Ashley doesn’t look like her more famous colleagues in the DC Universe. She’s a 13-year-old girl who is drawn to resemble a 13-year-old girl, rather than a miniature Amazon warrior. Lusky’s bright, friendly art owes as much to Saturday morning cartoons as it does to classic superhero comics. Her pages brim with playful energy. Her characters and their emotions bounce from one colorful panel to another. Muro and Krajewski’s writing sparkles whenever Ashley hangs out with Kitch, her offbeat foster father. Ashley and Kitch start off their relationship with jokes. Eventually, their shared sense of humor develops into a genuine love for each other. Muro and Krajewski’s handling of Yuka, Ashley’s scientist foster mother, is less successful. Ashley and Yuka both love sports, but because their commonality never pushes into deeper territory it feels forced. One hopes their relationship will get more attention in future volumes. What truly makes “Primer” stand out is Ashley’s, and her creators’, love of art, which shines through every page. Seeing her put on her superpowered paints fills me with the same feeling of possibility I had when I first realized that comic books — those tickets to another universe — were mere drawings on paper. I knew how to draw on paper. Ashley uses lines, swirls and splashes of color to interact with her world in a whole new way. Every one of her readers can do the same. Muro, Krajewski and Lusky mix beloved superhero tropes with the relatability of popular middle grade graphic memoirs like Raina Telgemeier’s “Smile” and Shannon Hale and LeUyen Pham’s “Real Friends.” Readers uninterested in Batman’s monthly exploits might be enticed to their local comic shop by “Primer.” “Mister Invincible,” by Pascal Jousselin, made quite a splash when it was released in France in 2013. Magnetic Press recently translated it for the American market, and this year it won the Best Middle Grade Comic award at the Bologna Children’s Book Fair. The title character turns the superhero genre on its head. Mister Invincible might wear a mask and cape, but with his potbelly and diminutive stature he’s built more like a loutish uncle from a comic strip. His power isn’t superstrength or the ability to fly. It’s his awareness that he’s in a comic book. More than that, he understands how the comics medium works. He can poke his head past the borders of his current panel to see into the future or the past. He can pass objects and even himself from one panel to another, moving through time and space. It’s as if Jousselin wrote a checklist of the medium’s rules, then set about having his potbellied hero defy every one of them. Most comic book aficionados have seen this sort of formalist play before. Scott McCloud’s “Understanding Comics” reprints a Matt Feazell strip where the stick figure protagonist crosses panel borders to borrow money from his future self. Jousselin pushes the gimmick so far, however, that it becomes an exploration of what makes a comic book a comic book. Each escapade is more inventive than the last. Mister Invincible doesn’t just fight villains. He shows us why comics delight us. On the very first page, Jousselin announces that Mister Invincible is “the One and Only True Comic Book Superhero.” Pretentious, but true. Unlike other costumed crusaders, Mister Invincible can’t ever make the leap to the screen. His powers and his appeal are too firmly rooted in comics. For their climactic battle, Mister Invincible and a ragtag league of misfit heroes take on an enemy who has already defeated Cricket Boy, the Pipistrelle and Rapidus the Lightning Guy — stand-ins for Spider-Man, Batman and the Flash. Mister Invincible’s team ultimately saves the day not with cosmic punches or fancy utility belts but by knowing just how fun it is to exist in panels on a printed page. Perhaps that is the lesson Mister Invincible teaches us longtime fans. The future of comic books lies not in ever flashier superpowers but in the wonders of the medium itself. "
40,"Sean Connery ‘Defined an Era and a Style,’ James Bond Actors Say","Sun, 01 Nov 2020 02:31:27 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/movies/sean-connery-james-bond-actors.html,Christina Morales,"Sean Connery was remembered on Saturday by other James Bond actors and franchise producers as “one of the true greats of cinema” who most embodied the fictional spy character James Bond. For James Bond fans and those who knew him, Mr. Connery, who died at 90 years old, was regarded as one of the best actors to embrace the role in “Dr. No” (1962), “From Russia With Love” (1963), “Goldfinger” (1964), “Thunderball” (1965), “You Only Live Twice” (1967), “Diamonds Are Forever” (1971) and “Never Say Never Again” (1983). Only four actors who played James Bond — also known as Agent 007 — in movies are alive today: George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan and Daniel Craig. David Niven, who played James Bond in the satirical spy film “Casino Royale” (1967), died in 1983. Roger Moore, who played James Bond for more than a decade, starting with “Live and Let Die” (1973) and ending with “A View to a Kill” (1985), died in 2017. Mr. Craig, who has played James Bond since 2006, said in a statement on the 007 website Saturday that Mr. Connery “defined an era and a style” with his films. “The wit and charm he portrayed onscreen could be measured in megawatts; he helped create the modern blockbuster,” Mr. Craig said. “He will continue to influence actors and filmmakers alike for years to come. My thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Wherever he is, I hope there is a golf course.” Mr. Lazenby, who played James Bond in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” (1969), said on Instagram on Saturday that Mr. Connery inspired him. “I met Sean a couple of times and I was pleased he’d given my Bond film, ‘On Her Majesty’s Secret Service,’ his seal of approval,” Mr. Lazenby said. “But, to me, the most important thing was his work went far beyond Bond: into charity, into family, into politics and into golf,” Mr. Lazenby added. “A man after my own heart. A great actor, a great man and underappreciated artist has left us.” Just weeks ago, Mr. Lazenby wished Mr. Connery “all the best” on his 90th birthday, calling him “the all-time greatest Bond.” “Sean, for me, was always the man,” Mr. Lazenby wrote. “I walked in his footsteps — I had to look and dress like Sean Connery — I went to his barber’s and tailors. I had no fear when I went up for the role — he was the guy who inspired me to never hesitate.” Mr. Dalton, whose first James Bond movie was “The Living Daylights” (1987), said in a statement: “Sean was a wonderful presence. A great leading man.” On Twitter on Saturday, Robert Carlyle, the James Bond villain Renard in “The World Is Not Enough” (1999), called Mr. Connery “a trailblazer, a true legend and a gentleman.” Producers Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli said on the 007 website that Mr. Connery revolutionized the world “with his gritty and witty portrayal of the sexy and charismatic secret agent.” “He was and shall always be remembered as the original James Bond whose indelible entrance into cinema history began when he announced those unforgettable words — ‘The name’s Bond … James Bond,’” they said in the statement. Mr. Connery’s death is the third James Bond-related franchise death since September. Diana Rigg, who died at 82, played a crime boss’s daughter in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service,” the only James Bond film to star Mr. Lazenby. In October, the “Goldfinger” actress Margaret Nolan died at 76. "
41,Best Sean Connery Movies to Stream,"Tue, 03 Nov 2020 02:04:11 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/movies/sean-connery-movies-streaming.html,Noel Murray and Scott Tobias,"Sean Connery died Saturday at the age of 90. Best known for originating the role of James Bond in movies, the Scottish actor had a career that lasted nearly 60 years, most of which he spent playing a variety of “man’s man” roles — from suave spies to violent brutes. At a time when most popular British thespians were known as Shakespearean-trained aesthetes, Connery became an international star with a screen presence that was earthier and sexier. His musical highland burr and awe-inspiring physicality immediately drew eyes and ears, even when he was playing opposite some of the most accomplished and attractive performers of his generation. These 15 movies go beyond Bond (though there a couple of can’t-miss 007 adventures in there) to illustrate how Connery commanded the screen, from his roguish youth to his distinguished latter years. “Dr. No” introduced James Bond to the big screen, but the second film in the series beefed up the mythology, expanding the entire concept of a superspy suavely combating would-be world conquerors. In the character’s first heyday, Connery grounded the increasingly outlandish gadgets, villains, sidekicks, and femmes fatale. While later Bonds (including some played by Connery) would became almost too cartoonishly glib, the 007 in “From Russia With Love” has a certain gruff gravity, even as he’s effortlessly seducing women and dispatching SPECTRE operatives. The third of the Connery Bonds established many tropes of the series: The stand-alone pre-credits action sequence, a tricked-out Aston Martin DB5, the eye-catching international locales and an array of silly gadgetry. (Bond is advised never to use the passenger-side ejector seat button, which of course only raises expectations.) “Goldfinger” is absurd beyond parody, with one of the best (and most plausible) evil-villain schemes in the franchise, and its lightness of touch makes it a standout among early 007 adventures. It’s the sort of movie where Bond has to free himself from a metal slab while a laser beam slowly moves toward his body. In one of Alfred Hitchcock’s more disturbing thrillers, Connery plays the wealthy Mark Rutland, drawn to Marnie (played by Tippi Hedren), whom he knows to be psychologically damaged. He marries her anyway, and dedicates time and resources to fixing her wide range of problems — from kleptomania to a violent fear of sex. As played by Connery (and written by the screenwriter Jay Presson Allen, adapting Winston Graham’s novel), Mark can be seen either as the kindly guardian of a troubled person or as a total sicko who gets off on controlling someone too broken to fight back. While Connery was becoming one of the world’s most popular movie stars as James Bond, he consciously took roles in films that let him show different sides of his personality and talent. The director Sidney Lumet pushed the star to give his best performance of the 1960s in an adaptation of Ray Rigby’s play “The Hill,” about a brutal British military prison designed to break the spirits of insubordinate soldiers. In a complex study of how the values of strength and discipline sometimes conflict, Connery plays a former officer who challenges the authority of his jailers and becomes a hero to his fellow inmates. The image of a pony-tailed Connery with a Fu Manchu mustache, thigh-high boots and a red loincloth has been known to turn some potential viewers away from the writer-director John Boorman’s visionary postapocalyptic allegory. But if you can accept that a lot of the silliness in “Zardoz” is purposeful, it’s surprisingly easy to fall under Boorman’s strange spell, and to appreciate Connery’s fearless performance as a rebellious warrior whose terrifying rawness shakes up a utopian society of timid intellectuals. In Sidney Lumet’s hit adaptation of the Agatha Christie whodunit, Connery joins a cast of international stars (Ingrid Bergman, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, and John Gielgud among them) who fall under the penetrating gaze of Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) after a passenger is murdered on a train. There’s not much to “Murder on the Orient Express” as cinema, since the bulk of the film involves Poirot interrogating the passengers one by one in the same train car. But it’s the ultimate brainteaser for amateur sleuths in the audience, even if they’re unlikely to see the big twist coming. Connery had one of his best screen partners in Michael Caine, in the director John Huston’s extraordinarily entertaining adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s rip-roaring novella. The pair play globe-hopping mercenaries and con men who stumble into an Afghan community where they’re briefly hailed as gods. A tongue-in-cheek take on old-fashioned Victorian adventure, the film sees Connery doing what’s almost a spoof of the classic British pulp hero — more dim and thuggish than noble. A film about aging and almost-forgotten legends, Richard Lester’s 1976 historical romance “Robin and Marian” has Connery as Robin Hood, returning from the Crusades to find Nottingham’s poor still suffering, the Merry Men scattered, and Maid Marian (Audrey Hepburn) living a life of anonymous service as a nun. Typical of Lester, there’s an enjoyable casualness to “Robin And Marian,” even as the heroes are worrying that they’re too past their prime to escape certain death. And though he still had decades left to go in his career, Connery is entirely convincing as an aged Robin, fighting to convince his true love that there’s still life left in her wearying bones. The director Michael Crichton’s crackling adaptation of his own novel has nothing more or less on its mind than delivering a twisty, entertaining little caper and it pays off handsomely. Looking resplendent in their mid-1800s top hats and mutton chops, Connery and Donald Sutherland are an appealingly roguish team of thieves conspiring to steal a gold shipment from a moving train. This isn’t any ordinary smash-and-grab job, however: They first have to acquire four keys from different sources to access two heavily guarded safes. Crichton devotes himself to detailing the complicated logistics of the heist; fun and suspense follow. The plot of Terry Gilliam’s children’s fantasy — or at least Terry Gilliam’s idea of a children’s fantasy — sends an ordinary little boy through a portal in his wardrobe closet, where he joins a band of thieves as they jump from one notable time period to another. Connery appears as King Agamemnon of ancient Greece, who adopts the boy after he inadvertently assists him in slaying an enemy. It’s the most joyous section of the film, as Agamemnon treats him with fatherly affection and the kingdom cheers him as a conquering hero. The kid looks like he would happily stay in that time and place forever, so it’s a comedown when he’s whisked along to his next stop: the Titanic. Connery won the best supporting actor Oscar for his robustly entertaining turn as Jim Malone, an Irish-American police officer who risks his neck to help Eliot Ness (Kevin Costner) assemble a team and bring Al Capone (Robert De Niro) to justice in Prohibition-era Chicago. Connery’s speech about “The Chicago Way” is the standout and it’s also illustrative of the partnership that anchors the film, with Malone providing the muscle and moxie essential for Ness to get Capone. “The Untouchables” is also crackerjack entertainment, reconciling the ostentatious style of the director Brian De Palma with the studio sheen of a Hollywood prestige production. Even though the director Steven Spielberg added Connery to the “Indiana Jones” universe primarily as a nod to the actor’s James Bond persona, he fits perfectly alongside Harrison Ford — two growly action heroes playing characters who deftly defy death on a daily basis. As Indy’s emotionally distant father, Connery brings some poignancy to the franchise, and perhaps was even responsible for loosening Spielberg up a bit. “Last Crusade” is lighter and funnier than any other film in the series, with a refreshing smoothness to the storytelling. The first and best of the Jack Ryan thrillers casts Connery as a rogue Russian submarine captain who enters into a dangerous cat-and-mouse game with Alec Baldwin’s Ryan, who has to figure out whether the officer intends to defect to America or threaten its Eastern shore with a nuclear payload. Connery’s Russian accent may be suspect, but his stolid yet soulful presence in “The Hunt for Red October” is critical to the dramatic tension, which hinges on hidden motives and shrewd calculation. Though the director John McTiernan was the top genre filmmaker at the time, hot off “Predator” and “Die Hard,” much of the suspense here comes from the heady, high-stakes chess match between the two leads. By appearing as a small-house British publisher in this classy adaptation of John le Carré’s novel, Connery was able to revive his 007 spy persona while adding the maturity and gravitas of a plausible real-world espionage plot. A murderer’s row of character actors — including Roy Scheider, James Fox, John Mahoney, J.T. Walsh, and Klaus-Maria Brandauer — fill out the cast, but “The Russia House” is notable mainly for the romantic chemistry between Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, who co-stars as a Russian who slips him notebooks that cast doubt on the Soviet Union’s capacity for nuclear war. For a thriller as flagrantly ridiculous as “The Rock,” actors of Connery’s stature are an essential ballast to keep the enterprise from flying off the rails. In Michael Bay’s flashy tale, Connery plays a former Alcatraz inmate and escapee who accepts a pardon in exchange for his expertise in helping break up a kidnapping scheme on Alcatraz Island. When a disgruntled Marine general (Ed Harris) and his men hold tourists captive on Alcatraz in exchange for $100 million, Connery and Nicolas Cage’s F.B.I. chemical weapons specialist are brought in to keep them from launching deadly rockets into San Francisco. “The Rock” is like watching a 136-minute trailer for itself, but it doesn’t take itself too seriously.

42,"Sean Connery, Who Embodied James Bond and More, Dies at 90","Mon, 02 Nov 2020 17:47:29 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/movies/sean-connery-dead.html,Aljean Harmetz,"Sean Connery, the irascible Scot from the slums of Edinburgh who found international fame as Hollywood’s original James Bond, dismayed his fans by walking away from the Bond franchise and went on to have a long and fruitful career as a respected actor and an always bankable star, has died in Nassau, the Bahamas. He was 90.  His death, in his sleep either late Friday or early Saturday, was confirmed by his family. His wife, Micheline Roquebrune, told the British newspaper The Daily Mail that he had struggled with dementia. “Bond, James Bond” was the character’s familiar self-introduction, and to legions of fans who have watched a parade of actors play the role — otherwise known as Agent 007 on Her Majesty’s Secret Service — none uttered the words or played the part as magnetically or as indelibly as Mr. Connery. Tall, dark and dashing, he embodied the novelist Ian Fleming’s suave and resourceful secret agent in the first five Bond films and seven over all, vanquishing diabolical villains and voluptuous women alike beginning with “Dr. No” in 1962. As a more violent, moody and dangerous man than the James Bond in Fleming’s books, Mr. Connery was the top box-office star in both Britain and the United States in 1965 after the success of “From Russia With Love” (1963), “Goldfinger” (1964) and “Thunderball” (1965). But he grew tired of playing Bond after the fifth film in the series, “You Only Live Twice” (1967), and was replaced by George Lazenby, a little-known Australian actor and model, in “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” (1969). Mr. Connery was lured back for one more Bond movie, “Diamonds Are Forever” (1971), only by the offer of $1 million as an advance against 12 percent of the movie’s gross revenues. Roger Moore took over for “Live and Let Die” (1973) and continued to play the part for another 12 years. George Lazenby’s career never took off. James Bond has been played by Daniel Craig since 2006. Mr. Connery would revisit the character one more time a decade later, in the elegiac “Never Say Never Again” (1983), in which he wittily played a rueful Bond feeling the anxieties of middle age. But he had made clear long before then that he was not going to let himself be typecast. He searched out roles that allowed him to stretch as an actor even during his Bond years, among them as a widower obsessed with a woman who is a compulsive thief in Alfred Hitchcock’s “Marnie” (1964) and as a raging, amoral poet in the satire “A Fine Madness” (1966). His first post-Bond performance was as a burned-out London police detective who beats a suspect to death in “The Offence” (1972), the third of five movies he made for the celebrated director Sidney Lumet. The others were “The Hill” in 1965, “The Anderson Tapes” in 1971, “Murder on the Orient Express” in 1974 and “Family Business” in 1989. “Nonprofessionals just didn’t realize what superb high-comedy acting that Bond role was,” Mr. Lumet once said. “It was like what they used to say about Cary Grant. ‘Oh,’ they’d say, ‘he’s just got charm.’ Well, first of all, charm is actually not all that easy a quality to come by. And what they overlooked in both Cary Grant and Sean was their enormous skill.” In the 1970s and ’80s, Mr. Connery gracefully transformed himself into one of the grand old men of the movies. If his trained killer in the futuristic fantasy “Zardoz” (1974), his Barbary pirate in “The Wind and the Lion” (1975) or his middle-aged Robin Hood in “Robin and Marian” (1976) did not erase the memory of his James Bond, they certainly blurred the image. Mr. Connery won a best-actor award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for “The Name of the Rose” (1986), based on the Umberto Eco novel, in which he played a crime-solving medieval monk, and the Academy Award as best supporting actor for his performance as an honest cop on the corrupt Chicago police force in “The Untouchables” (1987). Mr. Connery taught himself to understand that character — Jim Malone, a cynical, streetwise police officer whose only goal is to be alive at the end of his shift — by noting the other characters’ attitudes toward him. After reading Malone’s scenes, he told The Times in 1987, he read the scenes in which his character did not appear. “That way,” he said, “I get to know what the character is aware of and, more importantly, what he is not aware of. The trap that bad actors fall into is playing information they don’t have.” Even before his acting ability was apparent, the 6-foot-2 Mr. Connery had a remarkable physical presence, onscreen and off. Lana Turner picked him to play the war correspondent with whom she tumbles into bed in the forgettable 1958 melodrama “Another Time, Another Place.” He earned his chance as Bond when the producers Albert Broccoli and Harry Saltzman watched him walk. “We signed him without a screen test,” Mr. Saltzman said. Mr. Connery’s magnetism did not fade as he grew older. In 1989, when he was 59 years old and had long since discarded his James Bond toupee, People magazine anointed him the “Sexiest Man Alive.” His response was to growl that not many men are sexy when they’re dead. “The Man Who Would Be King” (1975), directed by John Huston, in which Mr. Connery played a British soldier who sets out to loot a country and is mistaken for a god, was among the highlights of his second act. When Mr. Huston had first tried to finance a movie based on Rudyard Kipling’s short story of the same name 20 years earlier, he intended the role of Danny Dravot, the exuberant rogue who fatally begins to believe in his own grandeur, for Clark Gable, the undisputed king of Hollywood during the 1930s and ’40s. (The role of his companion Peachy Carnehan, played by Michael Caine, was originally intended for Humphrey Bogart.) Mr. Connery was, Pauline Kael of The New Yorker wrote, “a far better Danny than Gable would ever have been.” She continued: “With the glorious exceptions of Brando and Olivier, there’s no screen actor I’d rather watch than Sean Connery. His vitality may make him the most richly masculine of all English-speaking actors.” Few actors, she added, “are as un-self-consciously silly as Connery is willing to be — as he enjoys being.” If he enjoyed being silly on the screen, Mr. Connery was darker and more complex when the arc lights were turned off. Always afraid of being cheated, he audited the books of almost all of his movies and sued anyone he thought was taking advantage of him, from his business manager to the producers of the Bond films. In 1978 he and Mr. Caine filed suit against Allied Artists, the distributor of “The Man Who Would Be King,” over the way their share of the movie’s receipts was calculated. (The case was settled out of court.) He was still at it in 2002, suing the producer Peter Guber and Mandalay Pictures for backing out of “End Game,” a C.I.A. thriller in which Mr. Connery was to star. He later dropped the suit. The lasting resentment behind his many lawsuits, which he carried with him from his childhood, was also one of the keys to his success as an actor. He was born Thomas Sean Connery on Aug. 25, 1930, and his crib was the bottom drawer of a dresser in a cold-water flat next door to a brewery. The two toilets in the hall were shared with three other families. His father, Joe, earned two pounds a week in a rubber factory. His mother, Effie, occasionally got work as a cleaning woman. At the age of 9, Thomas found an early-morning job delivering milk in a horse cart for four hours before he went to school. His brother, Neil, had been born in December 1938, and the usual meals of porridge and potatoes had to be stretched four ways. Once a week, if the family had a sixpence to spare, Thomas would walk to the public baths and swim “just to get clean.” Like the months that 12-year-old Charles Dickens spent working in a factory that made shoe blacking, Mr. Connery’s deprived childhood informed the rest of his life. When he was 63, he told an interviewer that a bath was still “something special.” His anger was never far below the surface. What he called his “violent side,” he told The Times, may have been “ammunitioned” by his childhood. (He sometimes acknowledged that side in shocking ways. In a 1965 interview, he said, “I don’t think there is anything particularly wrong about hitting a woman”; asked about those words by Barbara Walters in 1987, he said, “I haven’t changed my opinion.” He did eventually say he had been wrong, but not until many years later.) The same was true of his odd combination of penury and generosity. A passionate golfer — he discovered the game about the same time he discovered James Bond — he was the only player at the Bel-Air Country Club in Los Angeles who carried his own bag. Yet he gave the million dollars he earned on “Diamonds Are Forever” to the Scottish International Education Trust, an organization he founded to help poor Scots get an education. When asked why he was willing to take second billing as a coal miner saboteur to Richard Harris’s company spy in “The Molly Maguires” (1970), he said, “They paid me a million dollars for it, and, for that kind of money, they can put a mule ahead of me.” But he donated 50,000 pounds to England’s National Youth Theater after he read that the theater needed money. An ardent supporter of Scottish nationalism, he also gave 5,000 pounds a month to the Scottish National Party. As a national referendum on independence approached in 2014, Mr. Connery wrote an opinion article for The New Statesman arguing in favor of it. “As a Scot and as someone with a lifelong love for both Scotland and the arts, I believe the opportunity of independence is too good to miss,” he wrote. “Simply put — there is no more creative act than creating a new nation.” However, because his primary residence was not in Scotland, Mr. Connery was not eligible to vote. At the age of 13, Thomas Connery became a full-time milkman. Britain had been at war for four years, and any able-bodied boy could get a job. Three years later, with the soldiers coming home and work scarcer, he joined the Royal Navy. He signed up for 12 years, but was discharged at 19 after acquiring an ulcer. He had also acquired two tattoos on his right arm — “Mum and Dad” and “Scotland Forever” — and a small disability grant, which he used to learn furniture polishing. Then he went to work putting the finish on coffins. In his off hours he took up soccer (he played semiprofessionally) and bodybuilding. Bodybuilding led indirectly to acting. In 1953, he and a friend went to London to compete in the Mr. Universe contest. Mr. Connery got a minor award — third place in the tall man division, according to most accounts — but, more important, while there he heard about auditions for a touring production of the musical “South Pacific.” He was chosen for the chorus because he looked like a sailor and could do handstands. During the year Mr. Connery toured in “South Pacific,” he lost much of a Scottish accent so impenetrable that, he later claimed, other actors at first thought he was Polish. His name was shortened to Sean Connery. And he found himself a mentor. An American actor in the cast, Robert Henderson, gave him a reading program that included all the plays of George Bernard Shaw, Oscar Wilde and Henrik Ibsen, along with the novels of Thomas Wolfe, Proust’s “Remembrance of Things Past” and Joyce’s “Ulysses.” “I spent my ‘South Pacific’ tour in every library in Britain, Ireland, Scotland and Wales,” Mr. Connery told The Houston Chronicle in 1992. “And on the nights we were dark, I’d see every play I could. But it’s the books, the reading, that can change one’s life. I’m the living evidence.” The next few years were a blend of small stage and television roles. His lucky break came on March 31, 1957. Jack Palance was to have starred in Rod Serling’s “Requiem for a Heavyweight” on live television for the BBC. Mr. Palance had triumphed in the same role the previous year on “Playhouse 90.” But he canceled at the last minute, and Mr. Connery inherited the role of the aging boxer Mountain McClintock. Although miscast, a reviewer for The Times of London wrote, he had “shambling and inarticulate charm.” Within 24 hours, Mr. Connery had gotten his first movie offers. A string of B-movies followed, including “Action of the Tiger” (1957), a thriller starring Van Johnson in which he had a small part, and “Tarzan’s Greatest Adventure” (1959), in which he played a villain out to destroy a village. He also played a private in the all-star D-Day saga “The Longest Day” (1962) and a man enchanted into falling in love in Disney’s “Darby O’Gill and the Little People” (1959). “In these early films,” observed the novelist and filmmaker Michael Crichton, who directed Mr. Connery in “The Great Train Robbery” (1979), “Connery exudes a rich, dark animal presence that is almost overpowering.” His Count Vronsky opposite Claire Bloom’s Anna in a 1961 BBC television adaptation of Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina” caught the attention of the men who were about to produce “Dr. No.” Both Mr. Connery and the character he played were instant sensations. “James Bond is clearly here to stay,” Variety wrote prophetically after “Dr. No” opened. “He will win no Oscars but a lot of enthusiastic followers.” Mr. Connery and Diane Cilento, an actress he had met when they played lovers in a television version of Eugene O’Neill’s “Anna Christie” in 1957, were married on Nov. 30, 1962. Their son, Jason, who would grow up to become an actor, was born six weeks later. The marriage lasted, more or less, until Mr. Connery met Ms. Roquebrune, a French artist and fervent golfer, at a golf tournament in Morocco in 1970. She was married, he was married, and they both won medals. After their marriage in 1975, they lived in Marbella, Spain, mostly to avoid British income taxes but partly because of Marbella’s 24 golf courses. In addition to his wife and his son Jason, his survivors include a stepson, Stephane, and his brother. By the time he returned to the role of James Bond in “Never Say Never Again,” at Ms. Roquebrune’s suggestion, Mr. Connery was in financial trouble because his former accountant had put the money he earned from the Bond films into unsecured property investments. Mr. Connery sued and won a $4.1 million judgment for negligence in 1984, but told reporters, “I don’t foresee I’ll get any money.” Almost from the time he left James Bond behind, Mr. Connery shifted from gorgeous young man to character star. “The reason Burt Lancaster had a longer, more varied career than Kirk Douglas was that he refused to allow himself to be limited,” Mr. Connery told The Times in 1987. “He was more ready to play less romantic parts, and was more experimental in his choice of roles. And that’s the way I’ve tried to be. I don’t mind being older or looking stupid.” Often willing to take roles in bad pictures if the money was good enough, Mr. Connery was the voice of a computer-generated dragon in “Dragonheart” (1996) and a villain trying to unleash a weather catastrophe on London in the misfire film version of the cult British television series “The Avengers” (1998). But he had more than his share of late-career triumphs as well. He relished his role as Harrison Ford’s eccentric father in “Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade” (1989) — even though Mr. Ford was only 12 years younger than he was. The next year he played a Russian nuclear submarine commander trying to defect to the United States in the film of Tom Clancy’s “The Hunt for Red October” and a hard-drinking but naïve British publisher recruited by British intelligence in post-Cold War Russia in “The Russia House,” based on John le Carré’s novel. Mr. Connery’s last movie was one of his lesser ones: “The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen” (2003), an unsuccessful screen adaptation of a clever comic-book series about a group of Victorian heroes. In 2005, he told an interviewer that he was done with acting, less because of his age than because of the “idiots now making films in Hollywood.” Five years later, he told another interviewer: “I don’t think I’ll ever act again. I have so many wonderful memories, but those days are over.” Except for some voice-over work, and despite occasional talk of possible new projects, they were. On July 5, 2000, Mr. Connery was knighted at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh by Queen Elizabeth II. It was a knighthood that had been vetoed for two years by officials angry at his outspoken support for the Scottish National Party and his active role in the passage of a referendum that created the first Scottish Parliament in 300 years. The palace is less than a mile from the tenement in Fountainbridge where Mr. Connery grew up. He never removed the “Scotland Forever” tattoo that he placed on his arm when he was 18. Nor was he ever tempted to deny his identity or turn himself into an English gentleman. As he told The Times in 1987, “My strength as an actor, I think, is that I’ve stayed close to the core of myself.” "
43,"For Socially Distanced Parties, Magicians Have New Bag of Tricks","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 10:07:59 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/style/how-do-i-find-a-good-magician-pary-tricks-online.html,Kenneth Sturtz,"It was a Sunday evening, and Ken Scott’s audience was spellbound. Parents and children were oohing and ahhing as he delivered a string of miracles. A wave of the hand over a Statue of Liberty postcard and the statue vanished. A Crunch bar morphed into a Rubik’s Cube that was solved in a flash. And a spectator’s chosen card was found without Mr. Scott even handling the cards. Next he asked a boy and his mother to help, displayed a yellow luggage tag and said he would send their pet on an imaginary trip anywhere they want. The boy volunteered his dog’s name (Louie), a flight number (116), and a destination (New York City). Mr. Scott instantly opened the tag to show those exact things written on it. “Oh my God!” the boy said, smiling. “I can’t believe it,” his mother said. It was especially impressive considering, thanks to the more prosaic magic of Zoom, Mr. Scott was in Atlanta and his audience was miles away from each other. The show was filmed in his basement studio and streamed in real time. Whether the 54 people tuning in were seeking a sense of normalcy in isolated and disconnected times, or just couldn’t figure out that last trick, they were applauding from living rooms and kitchen tables in North Carolina, Louisiana, Texas, California and Georgia. As the coronavirus snuffed out live entertainment, magicians, like so many others, have been forced to adapt, trading traditional in-person performances for virtual shows. The shift has been particularly jarring for people of this specialty, who’ve long argued that magic is best experienced in person. “I think a lot of guys were realizing they had no backup plans,” said Stephen Bargatze, 65, the president of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, the largest organization devoted to the practice. (Only about 500 of its more than 14,500 members are women, but he said that number is growing.) “This idea that something like this could happen never entered their minds.” Mr. Bargatze has worked as a magician for more than 40 years. All of his shows including a planned tour with his son, the comedian Nate Bargatze, 41, were canceled earlier this year. Mr. Bargatze said the majority of his group’s members are amateurs or are fortunate enough to have other sources of income besides magic, like a pension or day job. The crisis facing full-time magicians is unprecedented. “It’s a scary, scary time right now,” he said. “We’re doing whatever we can to pay the bills and hoping it turns out OK at the beginning of the year.” Mr. Scott used to make a living performing 200 to 300 shows a year, mostly for schools and libraries in his area. One morning in mid-March he was walking offstage after a school show when he checked his phone and realized every email in his inbox was a request for cancellation. “That all came to a big screeching halt,” he said. “I literally saw my calendar just disappear.” Alexander Boyce, a dapper 23-year-old magician in Brooklyn who favors reinterpreting classics of magic, was performing 350 shows a year, mostly corporate performances and at “Speakeasy Magick,” a show in the McKittrick Hotel in Manhattan in far West Chelsea. But the show closed, and his corporate work dried up. “That all went away very quickly,” Mr. Boyce said. “And like everybody else I expected to just kind of take some time to work on some new material and rehearse alone and enjoy a few weeks off and jump right back into things.” Shawn Farquhar, 58, was crisscrossing the globe up to 285 days a year, mainly performing in 1,250-seat theaters on Disney cruise ships. He traveled so much that he received Christmas cards from pilots. But last fall he traded the long stretches away for his own theater in Vancouver. In mid-March, Mr. Farquhar was in Las Vegas for a spot on “Penn & Teller: Fool Us.” The next day, back in Canada, he entered a two-week quarantine at his home. Things came to a dead stop. He reluctantly closed his theater. With little to-do, he traded his suit and deck of cards for bluejeans and yard work. Along with Mr. Farquhar, magicians everywhere were realizing in-person events wouldn’t be returning soon and approached virtual shows with varying degrees of enthusiasm and equipment; setups ranged from a computer and webcam to elaborate makeshift studios. Mr. Scott was already teaching magic classes to children after school and decided he could continue the classes and avoid issuing refunds by going virtual. He was able to salvage about a third of his normally lucrative summer library show business with virtual shows. He borrowed some equipment and bought the rest, transforming his basement office into a studio complete with lights, cameras and green screen. There was a significant amount of trial and error; during an early show the sound cut out. He added a person to run the computer, redeveloped his show and slowly began doing birthdays, office “parties” and public shows. “I’m doing some virtual shows, but it’s definitely not what it was,” Mr. Scott said. “Obviously I want to go back to work full time.” Mr. Boyce hadn’t thought of doing virtual shows until a corporate client he’d worked with previously asked him to do one. The response was so positive that he decided virtual could work. He “MacGyvered” a studio in his apartment complete with lighting, backdrop, multiple cameras and a computer. He uses a switching software so he can run the setup on his own. With employees stuck home and restaurants and Broadway shut down, corporate clients he’d worked with began turning to him to spice up their virtual events or impress business associates. Mr. Farquhar turned to virtual magic out of boredom. Homebound and desperate to perform for an audience, he arranged a free Facebook Live show. He committed to an hour, thinking he could adapt existing material. He was struggling after 15 minutes. “I realized I was talking to a green light on a camera and there was no interaction,” he said. “It wasn’t Zoom, it was just me talking and trying to keep an energy up.” He found not being able to interact with an audience in real time to be “soul-sucking.” He tried Instagram Live, but he soured on that too. It wasn’t until a friend recruited enough paying customers for a Zoom show that Mr. Farquhar changed his mind. There were stumbling blocks, like keeping people engaged and dealing with dozens of audio and video feeds. But when he learned he could interact with the audience, he developed a dedicated virtual show. Jason Michaels, 45, of Nashville, had previously kept busy with college and corporate shows, as well as tours performing magic for military families domestically and overseas. “I kind of got in my head I don’t think magic works in a virtual setting,” he said. “It’s already hard to sell a magic show just in a normal economy.” But after months without work, Mr. Michaels hit a low point over the summer. He worried that after 17 years he’d have to join the ranks of magicians who take day jobs to pay the bills. After encouragement from several colleagues, Mr. Michaels invested in some equipment, put together a studio in his office and redeveloped his magic into two separate shows, one — a demonstration of superb card manipulation — just for entertainment and a second that incorporated an educational component. The trickle of income has helped keep him going. Kayla Drescher, 30, a magician in Los Angeles, was also reluctant to join the rush to virtual. Ms. Drescher spent the last three years touring with “Champions of Magic,” a five-person theater show. Her close-up card manipulation was done in front of a camera and projected onto a screen. But she said her high-energy performance style is heavily reliant on audience interaction, which can be difficult during a virtual show. “For me, doing shows through a screen just doesn’t have that level of satisfaction, but it also doesn’t have that level of satisfaction to an audience,” she said. To supplement her income, Ms. Drescher began teaching magic online, including a summer camp program and a magic date night for couples akin to a sip and paint class in sweatpants. She willingly agreed to virtual shows for children’s hospitals and other charities. But she has not marketed them to new customers. “My fear is that they’re going to see me as just a Zoom magician and they won’t then book me in person,” she said. “No matter how fancy the camera is or how hard you work, there’s no way the show over a Zoom is going to be the same live.” Magic — the ability to make people believe something that isn’t true — has long been an in-person contest between the conjurer’s finely honed skills and the spectator’s untrained eyes. Add a camera to the mix and everything changes. “When you come see me and I pull a solid ring through your finger, it’s a totally different experience than me pulling a ring through my finger,” Garrett Thomas said. “Magic is meant to be experienced.” In addition to traveling for shows, Mr. Thomas, 43, performed his brainy sleight-of-hand at bars and restaurants in the Buffalo area. That work has quickly faded, but Mr. Thomas, who has consulted for David Blaine, took a few months to figure out the best way to design a virtual show. “Most magicians I see just kind of took their show and tried to put it on Zoom,” he said. “And that works to some extent.” But Mr. Thomas took a step back to reimagine what a virtual show could allow him to do. The central challenge he faced was how to convince a virtual audience that what they were seeing on the screen was genuine. He couldn’t have a spectator pick any card from a deck or use a borrowed dollar bill to show it was ordinary. In television these challenges are addressed by including a live audience or spectators to act as a stand-in for the viewer, he said. Even then, people often assume C.G.I. or camera tricks are used. For Mr. Blaine’s television specials, Mr. Thomas said the programs were presented almost as documentaries about people enjoying magic, because there was no way to convince the viewer what they saw was a genuine illusion as opposed to television trickery. Mr. Thomas concluded that the best option was to take advantage of the opportunity presented by performing virtually. Camera angles, lighting and optical illusions can be employed and manipulated. Many of the effects in his 45-minute virtual show couldn’t work in person. “I want to remind people that just because you see it on a video doesn’t mean it happened that way,” he said. John Wolfson, 31, of Rochester, N.Y., was skeptical of virtual shows, but became excited by the possibilities and challenges of performing remotely. “We quickly decided that this could not be my regular show just put in front of a camera,” he said. “I knew I didn’t want to have any instances where I was explaining away or apologizing for the format.” In a show marrying the energy of “Blue’s Clues” with the whimsy of Bob Ross, a playful Mr. Wolfson makes a bowling ball appear from an empty bag and rhymes his way through a mystifying trick in which a rope is cut and restored. At one point he makes a pen vanish from his hands, showing them empty. Up his sleeve? He pulls his sleeve up to reveal his arm erased from wrist to elbow, his hand floating in midair. Later, his arm back to normal, the pen reappears in his mouth. With the benefit of a green screen, Mr. Wolfson brought his audience around the world and included a mix of traditional magic with tricks that wouldn’t be possible in person. He’s working on a new show with more green screen and special effects. He said he wants to ask a copy of himself to pick a card. Mr. Farquhar finally reopened his theater, Hidden Wonders, in a new space in late summer. The speakeasy-style site is hidden by an ordinary-looking curio shop. Guests learn the address after buying a $50 ticket. That doorknob on a shelf? Put it in the right spot and the hidden door opens. Local guidelines in Vancouver allowed Mr. Farquhar to begin weekend shows with 12 people in the 30-seat space. He’s preparing to roll out a hybrid show that will include the audience physically in the theater and a few dozen virtual patrons. Both will be able to see each other on a large screen. And he’ll be able to pick volunteers from either audience. He said he designed the show to be interactive; the audience chooses the direction of the show and magic by selecting items from a cabinet. It’s all meant to keep the audience’s attention, especially the virtual audience. “You have to find a way to engage them and keep them engaged while you’re doing it because they can easily be distracted by a thousand things in the room,” he said. Unfortunately, most magicians don’t have the resources to invest in large-scale shows. Mr. Bargatze said the prospect of investing thousands of dollars in the equipment necessary to create a presentable show has deterred many magicians from going virtual, especially older magicians. He said entertainers have a responsibility to not endanger their audience’s health, but that most magicians have used virtual shows just to stay afloat and are eager to return to live performances. He’s heard from magicians who have returned to smaller, socially distanced venues in areas with low infection rates. He said he’s started doing a handful of school shows, with hand sanitizer, face masks and smaller groups of students. Though they can’t perform the ultimate trick of making the coronavirus disappear, magicians hope and expect there’ll be a significant amount of pent-up demand for their trade after the pandemic fades. “Magic thrives when people are at their worst because people at their worst need hope,” Mr. Farquhar said. “And that’s what magic is.” "
44,Philip Pullman’s New ‘Dark Materials’ Book Brims With Familiar Delights,"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 05:42:52 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/books/review/philip-pullman-serpentine.html,Lev Grossman,"SERPENTINEWritten by Philip PullmanIllustrated by Tom Duxbury In Philip Pullman’s fantasy trilogy “His Dark Materials” every human being has a companion called a daemon who represents his or her soul, externalized and made visible as a talking animal. Your daemon can be a hawk or a ferret or a monkey, fierce or cozy or creepy, depending on what kind of soul you’ve got. It’s one of the cardinal rules of Pullman’s fictional universe that your daemon must remain physically close to you, but like most cardinal rules in most universes this one occasionally gets broken. When it does, it’s a trauma almost beyond description. Since the last volume of “His Dark Materials” appeared in 2000, Pullman has written two more (superb) volumes of a second trilogy called “The Book of Dust”, as well as a few interstitial bits and bobs that fill in the odd blank spot in his vast legendarium. His latest work, “Serpentine,” is one of the latter, and as befits its title it is the slenderest of creatures, almost plotless and at 80 generously illustrated pages barely thick enough to have a spine. Set five years after the events of the first trilogy, the story finds Pullman’s heroine, the unquenchably curious Lyra, in an unquiet state of mind. She was once (in “The Amber Spyglass”) briefly separated from her daemon, Pantalaimon, and ever since then she’s been haunted by the question of what he did while they were apart. It’s weird for a daemon to know something its human doesn’t, since they’re ostensibly two halves of one being. “But she had the obscure sense that she shouldn’t ask him directly; he would tell her when he wanted to. However, time went past, and still he didn’t, and it began to trouble her.” Lyra visits the home of one Dr. Lanselius, a pleasantly inscrutable fellow whom she first met in “The Golden Compass,” and much of the action, such as it is, consists of Lyra discussing the mystery of daemons with him while at the same time trying to conceal this conversation from her own daemon, thereby providing an object lesson in exactly what they’re discussing. More than a charming fantasy, daemons are a rich metaphor for the relationship of the self to itself. Even in our sadly daemonless world, our selves, like Lyra’s, are both whole and divided — into the conscious and unconscious, the part that observes and the part that is observed, the part that speaks and the part that listens. “You know, it isn’t really surprising that there are things about ourselves that still remain a mystery to us,” Dr. Lanselius tells Lyra. “Maybe we should be comforted that the knowledge is there, even if it’s withheld for a while.” “There are lots of things we should be comforted by,” replies Lyra, at her most Alice-like, “but somehow it doesn’t feel very comforting.” The good doctor’s daemon, it should be noted, takes the form of a snake, and as serpents do she whispers secrets to Lyra’s daemon out in the garden, truths that won’t necessarily surprise Pullman fans but that leave Lyra — who obviously hasn’t read “The Book of Dust” — shocked and shaken. “Serpentine” is a trifle, but it brings with it all the familiar delights of Pullman’s work: its effortless clarity, its intelligence, its ineffable mix of coziness and darkness, innocence and experience. By the end one feels dark shadows gathering around Lyra, not because of anything that has happened to her, because hardly anything has, but because of what she has learned, which belongs to that particular satanic kind of knowledge that leaves one less innocent, and that once known can never be unknown.

Young people are adapting to virtual school sessions, socially distanced play dates and visits with loved ones through Zoom. Change itself seems to be the only constant these days. And it’s a reality that is well reflected in the lives of Maureen and Francine Carter, twin sisters in “Twins,” the first book of the graphic novel series by Varian Johnson and Shannon Wright. Maureen and Francine (who now wants to be called Fran) are more like best friends than sisters. Their whole lives they’ve done everything together. But at the start of sixth grade, things just aren’t the same. Maureen, “the thinker,” wants to keep things just the way they are. The plan was to have the same class schedule as her sister so they could eat lunch together and she is perfectly OK with keeping their same group of friends (coordinated outfits and all). Francine, “the talker,” craves independence. She has a new style and is perfectly fine having a different class schedule. The close bond they have is at stake when both girls decide to run for class president. All this change leaves Maureen wondering if she is losing her best friend. Will these external changes dent their actual relationship? Johnson is a wonderful storyteller whose humor is poignant and refreshing. He respects his young readers, knowing they can handle characters who don’t always get it right: Adults make mistakes, friends don’t necessarily say the right words and sisters aren’t always honest with each other. Wright’s colorful illustrations interplay with the text in clever and commanding ways. Her art is an accurate representation of the real world — bodies are a variety of sizes; skin tones and hair textures are diverse. The visual details that capture Black girlhood help us understand the Carter family: hair bonnets for bedtime, the wide-toothed comb on the dresser, the mother’s variety of headwraps and headbands. There is a knowing here that goes beyond the author’s own experience as a twin himself. It is the sober understanding that for many Black girls, a joyful, everyday moment like shopping at the mall can turn quickly into a reminder that this world is not always welcoming. When Maureen goes to the mall with her friends, a white clerk ignores them and helps a white customer instead. This moment happens quickly, with no foreshadowing. Just as in life, no one knows when micro (or macro) aggressions will happen; they come when least expected and leave the targeted person upended. When Maureen makes her campaign speech to become class president, she promises to start a sixth-grade buddy system so that students have support while adapting to all the newness. In her speech, Maureen says, “Let’s be honest, everyone needs a buddy!” And she’s right. There is so much happening in the world. Many of our young people are feeling uncertain and anxious. Young readers need a friend, a special buddy, to help them navigate this new norm. This book is a comforting companion. “Twins” is a page-turner with moments that make you laugh out loud. Anyone with a sibling will appreciate the sarcastic and witty banter of these sisters. And all children will relate to the politics of where to sit in the cafeteria. While the reader learns that all twins aren’t the same and have different interests and needs, the reader also sees the subtle truth that Blackness is not a monolith, that there is no such thing as acting like a girl and that the one thing all people want is to be accepted for who they truly are.

46,"Float Like a Butterfly, Sting Like a Bee: A Book for Young Readers Brings a Black Hero to Life","Sun, 01 Nov 2020 23:46:08 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/books/review/james-patterson-kwame-alexander-dawud-anyabwile-becoming-muhammad-ali.html,Tochi Onyebuchi,"BECOMING MUHAMMAD ALIWritten by James Patterson and Kwame AlexanderIllustrated by Dawud Anyabwile Some people move through the world in italics, the rest of us in unadorned, austere typeface. These lightning-bolt figures are poetry surrounded by prose. So it was with Muhammad Ali and so it is in this vivid retelling of the legendary boxer’s youth. “Becoming Muhammad Ali” brings prose, poetry and full-page illustration together to tell this story, as if to say the teenage Cassius Clay can’t be contained in just one kind of narrative vessel. A fitting framework for a book about a sublimely gifted pugilist who spoke in rhyming couplets. “Becoming Muhammad Ali” is narrated in part by a childhood friend of Clay’s named Lucius, or Lucky for short. He introduces us to a world outside the ring: 1958 Louisville. A place with Whites Only signs that Clay’s father painted hanging over stores where neither he nor his son was permitted entry. A place with proprietors who would refuse a thirsty child a glass of water. The poem “Signs My Father Painted,” in a single page, ably accomplishes the task of world-building, pulling the veil back on a place riddled with contradiction at the center of which sits Black America: “Colored Waiting Room / This Way for Fun — Fontaine Ferry Park / Whites Only / Segregation Is Immoral.” But “Becoming Muhammad Ali” isn’t the typical overcoming-the-odds tale about how difficult it is, and always has been, to be Black in America. It celebrates Blackness. Clay recalls his Granddaddy Herman’s living room as if it were church: “Ebony magazine / was his bible.” Elsewhere, Clay states, “I am from Sunday fried chicken and chocolate birthday cakes, / from Levy Brothers’ slacks and shiny white shoes, / from Cash and Bird, / from storytellers and good looks, / from don’t say you can’t till you try.” In “My Friends,” Clay makes a ballad of his friends’ nicknames and the coltish, whimsical ways they earned them. The poetry of Clay’s inner life takes up most of the book, the meter varying to distinguish a young boy’s observations from his conversations with the figures around him. It makes for a kinetic, dazzling experience, to which Lucius’ charming prose perspective is a necessary counterweight. Through him, we receive a multifaceted picture of Black boyhood: admiration for his superhuman friend destined for greatness, awareness that their Blackness means they must move through the world differently from their white counterparts, emotional acuity in the boys’ love for each other. It’s all there. I wished only that Patterson and Alexander had provided more of it. Clay doesn’t have his radioactive spider moment until halfway through the book, a staccato sequence in which he descends into the bowels of a building to uncover a boxing gym. By then, we’ve seen him rejoice over a new bike, learn card tricks from Granddaddy Herman, protect his friends from bullies, stare at the stars, race a school bus and be shy with a girl. We’ve seen him, in short, be a Black boy, which is the gift of this book, the prism through which the myth of Muhammad Ali is cast. It also lends poignancy to his drive for success. Clay is 13 when his father shows him the magazine cover featuring a mutilated Emmett Till, a photo that galvanized the civil rights movement. Till was 14. Like the world many adolescents inhabit, the world that “Becoming Muhammad Ali” presents is complex, made up of segregation and backyard baseball, racial violence and report cards. But most importantly, it’s a reminder that once upon a time Cassius Clay, all poetry and italics, was a kid like the rest of us. It is my hope that Black children read this book, see themselves in young Clay and know that they too are poetry made flesh. "
47,‘Square Dancing Belongs Somewhere Far Away … Like the 1800s’,"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 05:24:50 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/books/review/lupe-wong-wont-dance-donna-barba-higuera.html,Erin Entrada Kelly,"LUPE WONG WON’T DANCEBy Donna Barba Higuera Great works of American literature often begin with an unforgettable sentence. Joseph Heller’s “Catch-22”: “It was love at first sight.” Ralph Ellison: “I am an invisible man.” How about “Call me Ishmael”? Well, make way for Donna Barba Higuera, whose debut novel opens with “My gym shorts burrow into my butt crack like a frightened groundhog.” Welcome to “Lupe Wong Won’t Dance,” an uproarious debut about a well-intentioned seventh grader named Lupe who dreams of joining the major leagues. Lupe’s uncle works for the Seattle Mariners and has promised to introduce her to the pitcher Fu Li Hernandez as long as she makes straight A’s. “If Fu Li can be the first Chinacan guy to pitch in the majors, maybe I can be the first Mexinese girl to throw a no-hitter,” she says. “Did I mention that baseball is life?” She’s well on her way to fulfilling her end of the bargain when Coach Solden announces that square dancing will be their next gym activity. Lupe is athletic and competitive — but square dancing? No, thank you. “Square dancing belongs somewhere far away where it can’t embarrass anyone, like the 1800s,” she says. Lupe may be able to throw fastballs, but she has no rhythm. When square dancing threatens to compromise her straight A’s, she must find a way to make it stop. Luckily, Lupe has never shied from a challenge. All she has to do is find a reason square dancing is detrimental to seventh graders. But when she makes the case to Coach Solden that square dancing is not recognized as an Olympic sport, Coach reminds her that baseball isn’t, either (though it will be next year). And when she questions the “hygiene aspect” of holding hands, Coach laughs and says, “This coming from the girl who holds the snot-rocket distance record.” When she learns that only boys can choose their partners — and they can only ask girls, who are obligated to say yes — she believes she has enough fodder to topple do-si-dos for good. In the context of middle grade literature, Higuera’s novel delivers on virtually every level. It’s remarkably funny, but many of the moments of levity are meaningful. Lupe misses her father, who died years before, and readers learn that her admiration for Fu Li Hernandez is tied to this loss. The novel is inclusive and authentic. Lupe is a particularly endearing narrator. Like any well-developed character, she is flawed but evolving, unique but universal. The way Lupe interacts with her school tormentor, Samantha, is refreshing. Although Samantha is clearly a bully, Lupe treats her as more of a nemesis and never shrinks in her presence. Lupe can be frustratingly selfish, but she is deeply loyal and kind to her friends. There are also subtle moments that add richness to the narrative. When Lupe argues against the heteronormativity of square dancing, for example, readers get a glimpse into how this personally affects Coach Solden. Although Lupe goes so far as to look for “stats on deaths during square dancing,” her research never leads her to the fact that Henry Ford forced square dancing into the national curriculum as a way to offset nonwhite influences on American culture. An interesting omission, considering the overall tenor of the book. Nonetheless, what starts as a self-serving mission for Lupe becomes something far greater for herself and, ultimately, her readers. This book has wide appeal and offers something we all desperately need: light and laughter. Higuera has knocked it out of the park. "
48,"In Times of Crisis, Life-Affirming Picture Books","Sat, 31 Oct 2020 05:19:21 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/31/books/review/nonstop-tomi-ungerer.html,Dave Eggers,"Tomi Ungerer, who died in 2019, was a wonderfully idiosyncratic, uncompromising artist whose books never condescended to young readers with platitudes or secondhand morality. His books, in fact, rarely seemed intended for kids at all. “If all these books still thrive,” Ungerer wrote about his oeuvre, it is because “they broke all the rules applied to children’s books peopled with cushy teddy bears in an illusory world where everyone is nice, happy and stupid.” Ungerer and Maurice Sendak were friends and contemporaries who shared an editor in Ursula Nordstrom, their bold champion at Harper & Row. They also shared a frustration with the limits of what Sendak called Kiddiebookland — “that awful place that we’ve been squeezed into because we’re children’s book illustrators or children’s book writers. Yes, we are! But isn’t our work meant for everybody? How infuriating and insulting when a serious work is considered only a trifle for the nursery!” It would be hard to argue that Ungerer’s NONSTOP (Phaidon, 48 pp., $16.95; ages 5 to 8) takes place in Kiddiebookland. For starters, it features no kids. In terms of plot, it depicts the collapse of civilization. I’m not sure it’s a bedtime book for any adult or child, but I am sure it’s a masterpiece. The protagonist is Vasco, a man in a suit and a cap, his face always in shadow, as he navigates a city and a world falling apart. It begins like this: “Birds, butterflies and rats were gone. Grass and leaves had withered. Flowers had turned into memories. Streets and buildings were deserted. Everyone had gone to the moon.” Vasco is lost and alone in a disintegrating, Hopperesque city. Luckily, his shadow knows where to go, and saves him — “just in time” is the refrain — from explosions and falling buildings (again, not Kiddiebookland). Soon Vasco meets a sluglike creature called Nothing, who asks Vasco to deliver a letter to Nothing’s wife, who has vanished. Vasco takes on the challenge, surviving a tsunami and a shipwreck before washing up on a grim beach. Above the shore stands a hospital containing only two souls: Nothing’s gravely injured wife and her newborn child, Poco. Nothing’s wife is not long for this world (still not Kiddiebookland). She dies, leaving Vasco to care for Poco. Together Vasco and tiny Poco pass through surreal landscapes full of lonely menace — frozen seas, dying forests, hungry tanks, empty trains, magma, deserts — before the story has a happy (though not stupid) ending. The book is dedicated to Ungerer’s brother, Bernard, who, Ungerer writes, “became my guiding shadow after our father died.” That Ungerer, an Alsatian, lived through the German occupation of France seems pertinent, too. In a world now facing environmental catastrophe and a resurgence of fascist sympathies in Europe and the Americas, “Nonstop” could not be more timely. Ungerer has created an all-ages classic, a fitting capstone on a fearless career — and just in time. At 34, Christian Robinson is still at the beginning of his career, but he has already established himself as one of the world’s pre-eminent picture book artists, with a spare paint-and-collage style that achieves a kind of witty, lyrical sublimity on every page. There are few awards Robinson has not won as an illustrator — working with writers such as Matt de la Peña, Mac Barnett and Adam Rex — but his last two books are solo efforts, and the results are extraordinary. Last year he published “Another,” in which a girl and her cat discover a portal to another dimension. There, an upside-down version of her and her cat exist. The book, probably the most concise examination of the multiverse ever conceived, manages a balance of levity and metaphysics that is uncanny. It can’t be improved upon. In lesser hands, his new book, YOU MATTER (Atheneum, 40 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8), might be a well-meaning but undelightful pamphlet on self-worth. It is about self-worth, in a way, but it’s also about the history of life on Earth — from the first ocean-dwelling microbes to four-legged creatures leaving the sea for land, all the way up to an astronaut looking down on our blue marble from space. Oh, and in 107 words, it somehow covers loneliness, death and rebirth, too. Like Ungerer’s “Nonstop,” Robinson’s “You Matter” isn’t meant simply to please or instruct children. His goal is nothing less than encompassing the world through an art form that relies on economy of language and image. Mastery of this art form is very, very tough, and its best practitioners somehow manage to delight kids and adults at the same time — both audiences appreciating the chaos of existence brought temporarily to order. Robinson’s books, like anything perfect, have that rare quality of the inevitable. They had to be. They always were. Sophie Blackall’s IF YOU COME TO EARTH (Chronicle, 80 pp., $18.99; ages 5 to 8) shares the vast scope of “You Matter,” though its text is more explicit in its grand objective. Her narrator is Quinn, a red-hatted young child based on a real person in Blackall’s life. The real-life Quinn has lived in Nigeria, Indonesia and Nepal, but Blackall met him in her native Australia and saw the globe-trotting young person as a worthy guide. “Dear Visitor from Outer Space,” Quinn begins, “if you come to Earth, here’s what you need to know.” From there, Blackall delivers on the promise. The book seems to contain everything — the world’s every river, flower, person, cruise ship and bottlecap. It covers sight, sound, sickness, conflict and inequality. It is overwhelming. Like Robinson (and Sendak), Blackall was known first as an illustrator, and has more recently begun creating the text for her books. “Hello Lighthouse,” from 2018, related the story of a lighthouse keeper facing obsolescence, and won a Caldecott. “If You Come to Earth” is more ambitious by a factor of 10. It’s far and away the best work she’s done. Blackall tackles every page with a different composition, an ambitious visual conceit. There are grids, spirals, close-up two-shots (twins identical but for a mole) and dizzying diagonals (all the world’s means of transportation in one hectic spread). No detail escapes Blackall’s attention, though; close reading is richly rewarded. There are cameos everywhere: Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Ella Fitzgerald, Mariah Carey, Garry Kasparov, a Richard Scarry supercar and the red-suited boy from Ezra Jack Keats’s “The Snowy Day.” Though its scope is expansive, “If You Come to Earth” feels, in the end, intimate. A number of characters, young and old, recur throughout, giving us the sense of reading a multigenerational family saga — only this is the human family in toto, with seemingly no culture or incarnation unrepresented. The people in Blackall’s world seem content to coexist on a crowded planet, happy to share a park or a train or a feast. “Many of my first children’s books,” Ungerer said, “were aimed at rehabilitating disreputable animals.” He meant snakes, rats and vultures, but the same might be said for humans. In Ungerer’s last work, and in the work of his successors Robinson and Blackall, people, despite all the trouble we make, can be redeemed. Even if it’s only within the span of a picture book. "
49,N.E.H. Funds Restoration of Statues Toppled During Protests,"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:19:11 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/design/NEH-statues-protests-columbus.html,,"In response to an executive order from President Trump condemning the destruction of historical monuments during recent racial justice protests, the National Endowment for the Humanities is allocating $90,000 to repair or rebuild damaged statues, including one of Christopher Columbus that was toppled in Baltimore. The agency said on Friday that it was providing funds for the restoration of three statues that were damaged during protests over the summer: the Baltimore monument to Columbus, which was tossed into the city’s Inner Harbor on the Fourth of July; a statue of an abolitionist and Union Army colonel, Hans Christian Heg, in Madison, Wis.; and a replica of a 19th-century statue in Madison called “Forward.” The N.E.H. said it would also help fund a new bronze of Frederick Douglass in Rochester, N.Y. A statue of the famed abolitionist was destroyed in the city in July but was quickly replaced. After the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, demonstrations erupted across the country, and protesters aimed to take down public statues, reinvigorating a debate over whether monuments to national leaders with complicated or violent legacies should stand. Demonstrators targeted monuments to the Confederacy in particular — none of which were included in the N.E.H.’s latest funding package. Mr. Trump’s executive order, issued on July 3, called the destruction of monuments an “assault on our collective national memory” and created a task force devoted to “building and rebuilding monuments to American heroes.” The chairman of the N.E.H., Jon Parrish Peede, was named a member of that task force. The funding came from what the agency calls a chairman’s grant, which is often used to safeguard cultural artifacts during emergency situations like hurricanes. Statues of Columbus have been targeted across the country because of his role as a European colonizer whose journeys led to the decimation of American Indigenous populations, but any plans to take down monuments to him often draw pushback from Italian-American organizations. The fate of the Columbus statue in Baltimore had been unclear. After protesters took down the statue, near the city’s Little Italy, and dragged it into the water, a group of Italian Americans fished the marble chunks out of the water and kept them in a private warehouse, The Baltimore Sun reported last month. Now, they’ll have significant help restoring the statue. Some episodes of monument destruction were harder to square with the messaging of the protesters. In Rochester, the authorities puzzled over who had torn down the Douglass statue after it was discovered on July 5 near a river gorge. Mr. Trump called the perpetrators “anarchists,” but the police said they had no evidence to confirm that. The N.E.H. said the funds would go toward Rochester Community TV to support the creation of another statue of Douglass, who lived in the city for about 25 years. It said a possible site for the statue would be the Rochester airport. In Madison, the statue of the Union Army colonel and “Forward,” which depicts a woman standing at the prow of a boat and clutching an American flag, had been taken to Detroit for repair, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported this month. The statues will be reinstalled on the state Capitol’s grounds. The N.E.H. also announced on Friday that $30,000 would be allocated to the digitization of archival materials documenting Bronx Community College’s Hall of Fame for Great Americans, an open-air colonnade lined with busts of historical figures like George Washington Carver and Edgar Allan Poe; the digitized materials are meant to be used for educational purposes while the colonnade is closed during the pandemic.

50,Two Museums Tried to Sell Art. Only One Caught Grief About it.,"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 23:14:46 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/design/baltimore-museum-brooklyn-art-auction-sothebys.html,Hilarie M. Sheets,"Two museums planned to sell works from their collections at a Sotheby’s auction on Wednesday night. One moved forward seamlessly, with the Brooklyn Museum reaping almost $20 million for seven works by artists including Henri Matisse, Joan Miró and Claude Monet. The other, the Baltimore Museum of Art, decided to pull its paintings — by Clyfford Still and Brice Marden — two hours before the heavily criticized sale after discussions with the Association of Art Museum Directors, a professional organization advancing best practices in the field. If the disparate reactions to the two sales are a bit bewildering, welcome to the world of deaccessioning, the often byzantine process by which museums get rid of items that no longer serve their long-term interests, whether by sale or donation. It’s common practice for museums to sell second-tier or redundant works languishing in storage rooms to generate funds for new acquisitions. But museums can run afoul of ethical standards set by the association — and risk being publicly slapped with sanctions that prohibit loans from member museums — when deaccessioning funds are put toward operating expenses. But the association relaxed its rules in April as it recognized the extraordinary financial pressures that the pandemic had placed on museums. It said that for two years, museums would be able to use deaccession funds not only to pay for acquisitions but also to underwrite the direct care of their collections. And, significantly, the organization offered leeway in how each institution defined such care internally. Brooklyn and Baltimore were quick to take advantage. For Brooklyn, which has laid off 7 percent of its staff since the start of the pandemic, the need was acute. Its director, Anne Pasternak, said the institution was “extremely conservative” in its selection of objects. A Carlo Mollino table, fetching $6.2 million at Sotheby’s, had been considered for deaccession for decades, given the museum’s stronger holdings of the artist’s work. “The Monet happens to be lovely but is not one of his great works nor close to the best in our collection,” Ms. Pasternak said. Likewise, the museum has been cautious in how the money would be allocated in its collection’s care fund. “We didn’t just say, ‘Here’s all the salaries for the conservators’; we estimated the time they would actually spend caring for an object,” she said. Baltimore, however, had a balanced budget and no layoffs or furloughs. Rather, its director, Christopher Bedford, who in 2018 deaccessioned seven blue-chip paintings to buy works by women and artists of color, seized on the opportunity to raise funds for more equity-based initiatives at his museum — in a city with a 68 percent Black population. With his curators and board, he designated the Still and the Marden, as well as a monumental canvas from Andy Warhol’s “Last Supper” series, which together were expected to yield $65 million. The museum said the sale proceeds would be used to acquire more work by underrepresented artists and to create an endowment for collection care that would free up about $2.5 million in the budget for staff-wide pay increases and other equity-oriented measures. Given the deep holdings of late Warhol, works on paper by Marden and the Abstract Expressionist movement as a whole, the leadership felt they could still richly narrate those histories without the works to be deaccessioned. “This is done specifically in recognition of the protest being led by museum staff to be paid an equitable living wage to perform core work for an institution with a social justice mission,” Mr. Bedford said early in October, after a summer of protests when museums across the country were addressing internal complaints of structural inequities and racism within the workplace. The museum directors’ association expressed no concerns at first. “They are in line with how A.A.M.D. has defined this resolution for this period of time,” its executive director, Christine Anagnos, said at the time of the announcement. But the blowback was swift from art critics, historians and museum professionals. The paintings to be sold were hardly second-tier, said Arnold Lehman, a former director of both the Baltimore (1979-97) and Brooklyn (1997-2015) museums. “I’m not at all opposed to deaccessioning,” Mr. Lehman said, “but Baltimore was selling masterpieces — as good as you’re going to get of late Warhol, as good as you’re going to get of Marden and a fabulous Still.” He was personally involved in acquiring the Warhol and Marden. The Still, a gift of the artist who lived in Maryland late in his life, is also the only work of his in the collection. A group of former Baltimore trustees led by Laurence Eisenstein petitioned the state of Maryland in an open letter to intervene. Baltimore’s current board chair, Clair Zamoiski Segal, fought back. “To suggest that the absence of these three works breaks the public trust omits the reality of the many individuals whose trust we have not yet won,” she said in a statement. Prominent donors said they had rescinded pledges. “I certainly do not believe that one sells masterpieces to fund diversity,” Charles Newhall III, a former chairman of the board, wrote in his resignation letter as honorary trustee on Oct. 15. “In my mind Chris Bedford is stacking the board with artists that he promotes, and the B.M.A. has bought paintings from.” Two acclaimed Black artists on the board, Amy Sherald and Adam Pendleton, then stepped down, without weighing in directly on the deaccessioning imbroglio. But Ms. Sherald, who spent her formative years as a young artist in Baltimore and is best known for painting Michelle Obama’s portrait, took umbrage at Mr. Newhall’s assertion. “This is a high mark of audacity to assume that I was nominated only to be used as a pawn for Christopher Bedford’s gain,” she wrote in her public statement. In an interview this week, Mr. Eisenstein said the critics of the sale agree with promoting diversity and pay equity but are opposed to “taking what seems to be a shortcut approach to monetize the art instead of doing the more difficult work of fund-raising and development.” Lori Johnson, a professor of art history at Morgan State University in Baltimore, said the attitude expressed by critics just maintains the status quo. “Saying we could raise funds through traditional means is basically how we’ve arrived at the place we are now — we still have underrepresentation and still have people waiting to have the careers they deserve,” she said. “There’s more at stake than these three works.” Rev. Dr. Alvin C. Hathaway Sr., of the Union Baptist Church in Baltimore, said he hopes the dispute prompts a healthy conversation in America around structural impediments to equality. “Is the value in the art or is the value in the accessibility of others to have access to the art and to have their art valued as well,” he posed. State officials never publicly intervened in the matter, but the association clarified its position this week in a statement from its president, Brent Benjamin. The funds for “long-term needs — or ambitious goals,” he wrote, “must not come from the sale of deaccessioned art.” Then, 14 current and former museum directors signed a letter to Baltimore’s board chair asking the museum to reconsider the sale. The museum ultimately decided to “pause” its plan to sell the works after a phone call Wednesday afternoon between association leaders and Mr. Bedford and Ms. Zamoiski Segal. But Mr. Bedford made plain in an interview on Thursday that the bigger conversation is not over. “As an institution, we value the perspectives of colleagues and understand the importance of adhering to the professional guidelines that govern our field,” Mr. Bedford said. “I do believe, though, that the moment has come to more deeply consider the standards by which museums operate. The turmoil we are experiencing is not simply financial; it is the result of entrenched systems that cannot sustain the moment or the future. Our communities are calling us to action, to move beyond words and symbols.” "
51,"Lil Wayne, Latest Rapper in Trump’s Orbit, Sees Backlash Over Photo","Fri, 30 Oct 2020 19:17:29 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/music/lil-wayne-trump.html,Joe Coscarelli,"For as long as Donald J. Trump has been a brand name — representing playboy bling and New York business savvy in the 1990s up through his freestyle approach to presidential politics today — he has flirted with hip-hop. Sometimes, famous rappers reciprocate. Yet even for a man who once palled around Manhattan nightclubs with Puff Daddy and Russell Simmons, and later hosted Kanye West in the Oval Office, President Trump can still surprise with his Black celebrity alliances, judging by the reaction on Thursday night to a photo op with Lil Wayne. “Just had a great meeting with @realdonaldtrump,” the multiplatinum rapper posted to his nearly 35 million followers on Twitter after the two posed together in Florida, earning a retweet from the president. “He listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done.” The photo immediately went viral on social media, but the backlash was swift as well, making Lil Wayne the latest in a recent line of rappers to align themselves, however briefly, with the president’s re-election campaign, only to face criticism from fans and fellow artists. Lil Wayne, like Ice Cube before him, had cited the president’s Platinum Plan, a two-page document rolled out in September that promised to “increase access to capital in Black communities by almost $500 billion” over the next four years. The radio host Charlamagne Tha God, of The Breakfast Club on Power 105.1 FM in New York, responded in a segment on Friday morning, calling Lil Wayne’s apparent endorsement a distraction. While he noted that Black voters are not monolithic, Charlamagne added, “Trust me when I tell you, Black people are not on the Trump administration’s agenda, nor will we ever be. All of our civil liberties are at risk.” Representatives for Lil Wayne did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday. Previously, ahead of the 2016 election, Lil Wayne had distanced himself from politics and the Black Lives Matter movement, saying he preferred to focus on music. Asked about Mr. Trump specifically, the rapper responded with a laugh: “Who’s that?” Earlier this month, the New York rapper 50 Cent also seemed to endorse President Trump in a post on Instagram, claiming that Joseph R. Biden Jr. would raise taxes. “I don’t care Trump doesn’t like black people,” 50 Cent wrote. “62% are you out of ya [expletive] mind.” (Instagram marked the post as “missing context” and in need of a fact-check.) But the rapper soon walked back his support for Mr. Trump, and on Thursday, he reacted negatively to Lil Wayne’s political post. “Oh no,” 50 Cent wrote on Thursday evening. “I WOULD HAVE NEVER TOOK THIS PICTURE.” Ice Cube, a founding member of N.W.A, who released a song called “Arrest the President” as recently as 2018, faced similar scrutiny after it was announced this month that he had consulted with the Trump administration on the Platinum Plan. He said later that he hoped to work with both sides, and was not endorsing Mr. Trump, adding, “I don’t trust none of them.” “Black progress is a bipartisan issue,” Ice Cube said. “I will advise anybody on the planet who has the power to help Black Americans close the enormous wealth gap.” Trump has called himself the best president for Black Americans since Abraham Lincoln, despite a questionable record on race, including his pronouncement that there were “very fine people on both sides” after white supremacists rioted in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017. His campaign has said that it hoped to slightly improve on its performance with Black voters in 2016, when Mr. Trump earned about 8 percent of the Black vote. Of course, plenty of rappers have endorsed Mr. Biden, including Cardi B, Offset and Snoop Dogg, while others, like Waka Flocka Flame and Lil Pump, who is of Mexican and Cuban descent, have signaled an openness to supporting the president. In an interview, the writer, filmmaker and activist Dream Hampton called it “the hubris of the celebrity” for rappers to “kind of saunter in during the fourth quarter, talking about making demands.” She noted that while Black men will still overwhelmingly vote for Democrats — Mr. Biden leads 78-11 among Black men, according to a recent Times/Siena poll — a macho affinity for President Trump and the allure of economic success could explain his inroads with a certain segment of the hip-hop community. “It’s the same reason they were referencing him in the ’90s — it’s about the lie of the American dream,” she said. “It’s about the lie of Black entrepreneurship somehow being a panacea to these larger social problems. Hip-hop became a stand-in for that, lifting up individual Black accomplishment.” “There are real reasons to criticize Joe Biden, even in this 11th hour,” Ms. Hampton added. “But we” — Black activists and organizers — “were already doing that.” "
52,"'The Mandalorian' Season 2 Premiere Recap: ""The Marshal""","Fri, 30 Oct 2020 19:32:13 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/television/mandalorian-season-2-premiere.html,Noel Murray,"Almost a year ago, the “Star Wars” spinoff series “The Mandalorian” debuted on Disney+ with a first episode that had been kept mostly under wraps — unseen by the critics and largely unspoiled by advertising. That secrecy preserved what turned out to be a wonderful surprise: the introduction a fun new character, called “the Child” on the show but immediately dubbed “Baby Yoda” by the fans. This tiny, adorable, superpowered creature became TV’s breakout star last fall, raising the question of what Jon Favreau, the creator of “The Mandalorian,” might possibly spring on the audience in the second season. Well, it turns out there’s no equivalent to a toddler-sized Yoda in the Season 2 premiere. But how about a full-sized Timothy Olyphant? Olyphant plays Cobb Vanth, the title character in this season’s debut episode, “The Marshal.” The show’s hero, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) — the Mandalorian himself — meets Cobb when he rides into the Tatooine mining community of Mos Pelgo in search of another member of the Mandalorian order of warriors and bounty hunters. It tuns out that our Mando has been misinformed. There are none of his kind living in Mos Pelgo, only a loping lawman who got hired to protect a town partly because he happened to buy some old Mandalorian armor off some Jawas. It’s hard to overstate how delightful it is when Olyphant first walks onto the screen as Vanth. Even under a Mandalorian helmet, the actor’s sun-baked California drawl is instantly recognizable. He also gives himself away by the way he stands, with one hip thrust sideways, skinny legs leaning at a steep angle, arms afloat at his sides … as though he’s ready at a moment’s notice to dive to the ground while firing a blaster. Even in the “Star Wars” universe, the man who played Seth Bullock and Raylan Givens looks like … well, like a marshal. The first season of “The Mandalorian” relied a lot on guest stars like Olyphant, who usually weren’t announced to the press ahead of time. (Favreau and Disney do like their little surprises.) Building the Season 2 premiere around a team up between the Mandalorian and the Marshal is a reassuring sign that this show probably won’t move too far away from what worked last year. Season 1 built to a satisfyingly epic showdown, featuring most of the series’s major characters. But much of the appeal of “The Mandalorian” has come from its old-fashioned episodic structure. Nearly every chapter so far has followed the hero and the Child on a new adventure in a new location. So while “The Marshal” picks up where last season’s finale left off — with Mando accepting the assignment to reunite the Child with his own people — the story immediately reverts to the task-oriented plotting that made the first season such a joy. The length of “The Marshal” is somewhat worrisome. Season 1 episodes of “The Mandalorian” typically clocked in at between 30 to 40 minutes. The Season 2 premiere runs 54 minutes, and I can’t say every second is necessary. The bulk of this chapter has to do with Vanth and Djarin working together with a cadre of Tusken Raiders to save their region from a Krayt dragon: a kind of giant underground worm-thing that eats living creatures and vomits up torrents of venom. The climactic action sequence features two steely men of action zipping around in Mandalorian jet-packs. It’s nifty to look at, but it takes a long time to set up a fairly routine man-vs.-monster shootout. Still, there are plenty of highlights scattered throughout this hour. Favreau is credited as both the writer and director, and he sets the right tone from the start with a good, pulpy opening sequence. When the Mandalorian and the Child visit a shady character named Gor Koresh (John Leguizamo) at an underground ax fight, Favreau lingers over the grubby details of a crumbling neighborhood with graffitied walls and an off-the-books club filled with creepy aliens. The scene pays off well, too, with the Child zipping up into his little floating egg while Mando clobbers his way through every thug in the room. Once he’s back on Tatooine, the Mandalorian reunites with Season 1’s hilariously energetic Mos Eisley spaceport manager, Peli Motto (Amy Sedaris), who once again coos over the Child and asks if she can have him. (When her offer is rejected, she tells Mando to let her know “if this thing ever divides or buds.”) And then Din is off to Mos Pelgo, mounted on a speeder-bike that rides steadily over the sand dunes … like a horse crossing Monument Valley in old John Ford western. So sure, “The Marshal” could be a little more taut. But there’s an assuredness to what Favreau and his cast and crew are doing here, calling back once again to classic movie adventures, in much the same way George Lucas did with the first “Star Wars” film. And there’s something else going on, too — it was reflected both in bits of dialogue, as when Peli gripes that she doesn’t even know “who to complain to” about her creaky R5 unit, and in longer expository interludes, like Cobb’s story about the evil consortium that swooped into Mos Pelgo on the night the Death Star blew up. These are all part of what’s quickly becoming the larger theme of “The Mandalorian,” about what happens when a galaxy falls into disorder and disarray. Nothing works right. No one’s where they’re supposed to be. Even good folks like the Marshal are wearing outfits that don’t belong to them. It’s up to the Mandalorian and the Child to start putting things back in place. And if this season is as good as the last one was, they’ll keep doing that one small step at a time, side-by-side with some of Hollywood’s greatest character actors. "
53,"Enzo Mari, Industrial Designer Who Kept Things Simple, Dies at 88","Fri, 30 Oct 2020 22:05:19 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/design/enzo-mari-dead-coronavirus.html,Penelope Green,"This obituary is part of a series about people who have died in the coronavirus pandemic. Read about others here. Enzo Mari, an irascible industrial designer, artist and polemicist who made simple, beautiful objects, including toys and traffic bollards, that delighted generations of Italians and design buffs all over the world, died on Oct. 19 at a hospital in Milan. He was 88. The cause was complications of the coronavirus, said Hans Ulrich Obrist, who, with Francesca Giacomelli, curated a major retrospective of his work at the Triennale Design Museum in Milan, which opened two days before his death. Mr. Mari’s wife, Lea Vergine, an art critic, theoretician and performance artist, also died from the coronavirus, on Oct. 20, at 82. Mr. Mari was known as much for his grumpy pronouncements on the state of design — which he disdained as mostly unnecessary and a waste of labor and material — as for his own designs. His most beloved works include an elegant platter made from a slightly bent I-beam (a functional art piece that presaged Donald Judd’s explorations by a few years); a cunning puzzle of 16 animals jigsawed from a single piece of oak; a perpetual calendar that worked like old traffic signals, with days and months printed on plastic cards that pivot out; and a do-it-yourself handbook and anti-industrial manifesto for making furniture using only nails and standard lumber (no need for fancy joinery, or a fancy designer). That all of these things became collectibles for design aficionados was particularly irritating to him. Deeply imprinted by the Marxism of the era he grew up in, and by his family’s impoverished beginnings, Mr. Mari fretted about the nature of work and the suffering that came from so-called alienated labor. He wanted to make things that were useful, but that would also bring pleasure to the worker who manufactured them. He was annoyed by fame, too; he once slammed Rem Koolhaas, the well-known Dutch architect and urban theorist, as “a pornographic window dresser.” In response, Mr. Koolhaas shook his fist at Mr. Mari. (It was in 2006, and the two men had been invited to speak at the Serpentine Gallery in London by Mr. Obrist, the gallery’s director, who said recently that their behavior was more theatrical than aggressive, like that of two lions growling at each other.) Along with Ettore Sottsass, Vico Magistretti, Cini Boeri, Andrea Branzi and Pier and Achille Castiglioni, Mr. Mari was a leader in the postwar generation of industrial designers whose work for Danese, Olivetti, Alessi, Artemide and other forward-thinking companies produced what Mr. Obrist called “the Milan Miracle.” “Here were risk-taking manufacturers who hired these visionary designers,” Mr. Obrist said in a phone interview. “They were all very different, but they all believed that world-class design should be for everyone. That it shouldn’t be a luxury thing. Mari was the most extreme; he really wanted to get rid of this idea of commerce, industry and advertising.” Mr. Mari also made paintings, sculptures, posters, manifestoes, manuals, games and what artists call “propositions.” For an art fair in the late 1960s, he made a conceptual gallery for one person: a giant cantilevered box with a mirror inside, the top of which fit over one’s head. The point was that what was on view was your own reflection. It came with a questionnaire, written with the Italian semiotician and novelist Umberto Eco, that read in part: “Many of Mari’s works are masterpieces — rare combinations of intellectual puzzles and beautiful lines,” the British product designer Jasper Morrison told the design critic Alice Rawsthorn for The New York Times in 2008. “Most designers who analyze problems to the extent that he does end up with rather dry, systemized solutions. His works are highly original and uncompromising, with a kind of poetic and heroically human touch.” Among his most humble and humane designs are the cement “panettone” bollards that have dotted the Milan streetscape since the 1980s. Named for the Milanese cake from which they take their shape, the bollards are ubiquitous and adorable, and useful not just for organizing vehicular traffic but also as impromptu benches to plop down on for a quick smoke or sandwich. “They are one of the most beautiful elements of the city,” Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, said in a phone interview. “To me Enzo Mari means Milan. It’s not easy to make something that becomes part of everybody’s lives. “People always talk about him as a curmudgeon,” she continued, “and it’s all true, but I always found him so poetic and romantic. Maybe it was an armor.” Enzo Mari was born on April 27, 1932, in Novara, Italy. His father, Luigi, was an orphan who at 15 traveled on foot with his younger brother from Puglia to Milan and lived on the streets there. Luigi apprenticed with a barber and a shoemaker and eventually opened his own business, a combination cobbler and barber shop. Enzo’s mother, Carolina (Stagnoli) Mari, worked in a rice field and later in a textile mill. Enzo and his two younger brothers grew up in Milan. When his father became ill, Enzo dropped out of high school to support the family, working as a peddler and doing odd jobs. He attended the Brera Academy of Fine Art — because, he said, it was close to where his parents lived and did not require a high school diploma. He took courses in painting, sculpture, decoration and stage design; he wasn’t interested in theater but ended up there after art professors complained that he asked too many questions. After graduating in the mid-1950s, he was among a group of young avant-garde artists who made what they called Arte Programmata, or kinetic art. Two of them, Mr. Mari and Bruno Munari, went to work for Danese Milano, an industrial design company whose owners, Bruno Danese and Jacqueline Vodoz, shared their goal of producing beautiful, useful objects for everyone, not just the rich. Social transformation in a fork, so to speak. Over his long career, Mr. Mari also designed for Alessi, Artemide, Muji and Le Creuset, among many other companies. He was a design professor at the Humanitarian Society School in Milan in the early 1960s. He was awarded the Compasso D’Oro, or Golden Compass, Italian industrial design’s highest honor, four times. He also made children’s books with his first wife, Gabriela Ferrariol, an illustrator and designer he had met in art school, who went by the name lela (with a lowercase “l”) Mari. They had a daughter, Agostina, and a son, Michele, who survive him. His survivors also include Meta, his daughter with Ms. Vergine, and two brothers, Maria and Elio. For the museum retrospective, Mr. Obrist and Ms. Giacomelli chose 250 objects, a fraction of the 1,500 items that make up Mr. Mari’s creative archive, which he donated in its entirety to the city of Milan with a caveat that it not be shown for 40 years. (The show is up until April 2021, after which the curators hope it will go on tour.) “I am convinced, like a slightly optimistic child, that it will take 40 years before we have a new generation that is not as spoiled like today’s generation,” Mr. Mari told Mr. Obrist in an interview included in the show’s catalog. “I am extremely hopeful that in the near future there will be a generation of young people who will react and take back control of the profound meaning of things.” "
54,TV’s Horror Hosts: 70 Years of Screams and Cheese,"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 17:50:45 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/television/halloween-tv.html,Erik Piepenburg,"Vampires, demons, Michael Myers — in horror, many things never die. One Cleveland television station is betting there’s something else that’s immortal: the appetite for horror hosts. Halloween night brings the third episode of “The Big Bad B-Movie Show,” a new locally-produced schlock horror movie series on CW43, the city’s CW affiliate. It’s hosted by Zachariah Durr, 40, and Laura Wimbels, 37, who play Leopold and Lenora, two dapper, wisecracking ghouls trapped in a vault. The two are part of a new generation of horror hosts, those late-night cheeseball M.C.s who supplement terrible movies with wink-wink sketch comedy and goofy gags, delivered in accents that land somewhere between Transylvania and the Catskills. What’s unusual about “The Big Bad B-Movie Show” is more than just “the two weirdo people” who host it, as Durr put it. Most horror hosts today stream exclusively online, and it’s usually too costly for a local broadcast station to produce a new weekly horror series. (It also streams online after the broadcast concludes.) But in Durr, a video producer for CW43, the station lucked out: He eagerly agreed to host the series as a labor of love. “We are all trapped in our cities,” he said. “We might as well be producing something fun.” Horror hosts have been (mildly) scaring fans since the 1950s, first on broadcast television and then online, where they remain ubiquitous. The formula — a hammy host, a B movie, hokey skits — has barely changed. Neither, really, have gender roles; men are generally funny, women are usually vamps. This Halloween, Leopold and Lenora are two of many horror hosts helping to feed the pandemic-bred appetite for nostalgic comfort viewing, a welcome distraction for families with kids who will spend Halloween at home because of coronavirus restrictions. In Austin, Tex., Joseph Fotinos, a local host known as Professor Anton Griffin, kicks things off with an after-midnight special in the wee hours of Halloween morning on the city’s CBS affiliate. In the Quad Cities market, covering southeastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois, Marlena Midnite will host a Halloween night double feature of “The Brain That Wouldn’t Die” (1962) and “Lady Frankenstein” (1971) on a MyTV station. Cassandra Peterson — better known as the vixen horror movie hostess Elvira — said that when real-life terror becomes overwhelming, a family-friendly B-movie presented by a chummy ghoul can help take off life’s scary edge. “Horror hosts show you comforting things from your childhood that you watched with your family or friends,” she said. “That those things have horror themes is neither here nor there. It just feels good to go back to that place.” According to Stacey Abbott, the co-author of “TV Horror: Investigating the Dark Side of the Small Screen,” the horror host format emerged as local stations in search of cheap content bought packages of old Hollywood horror movies to create a programming slot with minimal production costs. Station employees were often enlisted to moonlight as costumed creatures after their evening shifts ended. “It made more of an event of screening old movies, and it worked really well,” Abbott said. The format first clicked in 1954, when a young Finnish-American actress named Maila Nurmi squeezed into a cinched black dress and applied a crimson lip to become Vampira, a va-va-voom bloodsucker on KABC in Los Angeles. Three years later, John Zacherle played an undertaker host on TV in Philadelphia, where he was known as Roland, and later in New York, where he took the name Zacherley. The phenomenon took off in other cities, where hosts became local celebrities. In 2011, the first class in the virtual Horror Host Hall of Fame included three personalities from Ohio alone, including Cleveland’s Ghoulardi, played by Ernie Anderson, the father of the acclaimed filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson (“There Will Be Blood,” “Phantom Thread”). Abbott said the format started to peter out in the 1970s as stations moved toward more syndicated content and away from paying people to make original shows. But that changed in the ’80s, when Elvira helped usher in a new Golden Age by introducing the VHS generation to the horror host format in her show “Movie Macabre.” The gig helped make her a household name. Fast forward to the digital age, and anyone with a laptop, green screen, vintage frippery and pancake makeup can have his or her own series. A few long-timers are still at it. Joe Bob Briggs, a noncreature host, has a series on the horror streaming platform Shudder. Dick Dyszel has played Count Gore De Vol, a love child of Bela Lugosi and Sid Caesar, since the 1970s and has been online since the early days of the internet. Svengoolie, a long-running Chicago horror host originated by Jerry G. Bishop and now played by Rich Koz, has a weekly show on MeTV stations that, according to the network, reaches an average three million viewers each week. Horror hosts also have a documentary about their weird world, “American Scary,” streaming on Amazon, and a virtual meeting place at EerieLateNight.com, where horror hosts and their fans chat and watch old horror movies around the clock. What they don’t have is women and people of color as hosts, at least not in the numbers that reflect the diversity of horror fandom. CW43’s Wimbels, a freelance photographer who is Hispanic and grew up in Cleveland, said she was thrilled to expand even slightly the small circle of female hosts of color. “I was one of the uncool kids,” she said. “Growing up, I was dark and stuck out like a sore thumb. I was adopted. We didn’t have cable. But I watched ‘The Twilight Zone’ and old movies and TV shows, and they gave me comfort. To get to be a horror host — it’s incredible.” “The Big Bad B-Movie Show” is CW43’s first local non-news program of original scripted content in almost 30 years. Erik Schrader, the station’s vice president and general manager, said the idea surfaced around July when he needed to fill the Saturday prime-time slot. “We asked ourselves, do we show repeats or something creative?” he said. “We went for the creative angle because we believe that advertisers are going to be interested in something locally produced that has an original energy.” Schrader said he had been looking for locally-produced programming when the opportunity to buy some old horror movies came across his desk. A fan of “Mystery Science Theater 3000,” he gave “The Big Bad B-Movie Show” a greenlight because the idea was a hit at the station and because the production costs were “not going to rival ‘Star Wars.’” The set — a deliberately cheap-looking basement vault — is a storage room. That CW43 is willing to spend even a dime on a new scripted show during a time of considerable revenue instability attests to the enduring appeal of the horror host format, nearly 70 years after its birth. So far, the gamble seems to have paid off. Schrader said that the preliminary ratings for the first episode of “The Big Bad B-Movie Show” were higher than expected. Audience feedback has been positive. His boss is happy. Like the undead, viewers have a hunger for more. “People are rooting for it,” he said of the show. “I hope it’s around for a good, long while.” "
55,From Fashion to a Fantasia in Stone,"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 17:49:07 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/design/priscilla-rattazzi-utah.html,Ruth La Ferla,"Priscilla Rattazzi sealed her reputation as a fashion photographer in the 1980s. By the end of that decade, Ms. Rattazzi, a Roman living in New York, had turned from fashion to portraiture, capturing the likenesses of Diana Vreeland, Loulou de la Falaise, Gianni Agnelli (her uncle), and other contemporaries with an unexpected combination of astringency and warmth.  The seemingly incompatible mix is part of what distinguishes “Hoodooland,” Ms. Rattazzi’s exhibition at the Staley-Wise Gallery in SoHo through Nov. 14. The show’s title is a reference to Hoodoos, the majestically powerful rock sculptures formed across millenniums in the region of Lake Powell and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah.  In her improbably portrait-like photographs, Ms. Rattazzi brings to life the area’s mushroom-capped towers of sandstone, basalt and lime, imbuing them with an eerie humanity. Her work is a simultaneous homage to a magical landscape and an impassioned retort to President Donald J. Trump’s 2017 order to reduce the area’s protected lands by nearly half (47 percent).  Here she discusses what moved her to fix her lens on the region. These are excerpts from the conversation.   To what degree is this show a political statement?  I really worked hard to have it run before the election because I thought it could get some traction. While I was shooting the project, Trump cut the monument in half. I’m an environmentalist and I really care about the land and the beauty of the land. I worry that I could come back next year and there would be oil rigs.     Did you feel an intimate connection with some of these rocks?  I still see them as almost human. One of these towers seems to have breasts; others in the back of the room are somehow phallic. My guide Yermo, who knows the place so well, liked to point out that one of them looks like an angry middle finger.    Another looked as if it had no gender. Part human, part alien, it reminded me of the bar scene in the first “Star Wars” movie. I just had this fantasy of an army of magical creatures.  Some of these columns are called ghosts. They appear faint because they are sandstone, which gets eroded more easily in a flash flood. You seem to have captured their markings with an artist’s brush.  This is my first big digital show. I realized these textures called for more sharpness, and that they register better with a digital camera. Without one, I would have felt behind the curve.   You made your reputation as a fashion photographer. What prompted you leave fashion behind? I stopped because I became a mother. When my son was just a year old, an assignment came up for a major magazine. I felt such stress; I realized that I wasn’t going to be able to do it all. I decided then to work on photography books as a way of controlling my time.  Does your past work in fashion and portraiture still color your imagination? It does. One of these monuments looks to me like a female torso. She is “wearing” a beautiful hat. Another one has on what looks like a cape. To my mind, these rocks are very stylish.  They appear to strike poses against an unforgiving backdrop. Yet, in the midst of this pandemic, that backdrop seems especially attractive. Do you see it as a getaway?  If you come from New York, where I have been living since 1974, you can really appreciate all this emptiness and flatness, the idea that you could drive for hours and not see a soul. It makes for a perfect kind of social distancing. To go out and experience this vastness was really special for me.     But the landscape can be intimidating. Is that also a draw?  Scariness is part of the thrill. People say the place is almost menacing. At the same time, it is incredibly photogenic. The area is otherworldly.  As I put up my camera, it wasn’t hard to capture that. You lose yourself. But you definitely don’t want to be there on your own.  Did this project pose special challenges for you? One day right after lunch the sky became very black. I told Yermo, “Maybe we should go back to the car or find shelter in a cave.” But we didn’t; we just kept walking. And then it started pouring rain. The storm engulfed us. Lightning bolts were coming down to the left and to the right, some of them not more than 50 yards away. At the end I put my hands up. I told myself, I’m just going to keep going. We Italians believe that when your time is up your time is up.           "
56,Review: ‘Touch of the Poet’ is a Powerful Study in Toxic Pride,"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 17:06:34 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/theater/touch-of-the-poet-review-irish-rep.html,Maya Phillips,"It’s all Byron’s fault. Before James Dean and Gary Cooper and Heathcliff and Rochester — all the real and fictional men lounging at the center of the Venn diagram of “bad boys” and “sad boys” — Byron made such a career of drinking, lusting and gallivanting that he became a type. The Byronic hero: temperamental, hedonistic and romantic. “I am such a strange mélange of good and evil,” the poet once wrote of himself, “that it would be difficult to describe me.” Save it for your Tinder profile, bro. Byron also embodied a masculine ideal defined by paradoxes. A man of society who scorns status. A virile lover made impotent by ennui. A dreamer plagued by disillusionment. These contradictions sit at the heart of Eugene O’Neill’s 1942 play “A Touch of the Poet.” Irish Repertory Theater’s new online production, with its cunning use of technology and design — each actor filmed separately but sharing the same virtually rendered set — provides a hearty serving of digital theater that nearly matches the real thing. But first, back to the sad boys. O’Neill wasn’t exactly known for happy plays, and “A Touch of the Poet,” one of his later works, bears that signature. A lengthy domestic tragedy about toxic pride and futile posturing in an American society that won’t validate delusions of grandeur, the play makes Byron its patron saint, heralded and prayed to and emulated as the “poet and nobleman who made of disdain immortal music.” Beautiful, isn’t it? But the man with Byron on the brain, Major Cornelius “Con” Melody (Robert Cuccioli), can’t make anything but a dissonant racket of his disdain. So he borrows the words of Byron, quoting the poet in front of the mirror as though he’s trying to enchant himself: “I stood among them but not of them,” he says grimly, considering his environs. It’s 1828, and he’s the owner of a pub in Massachusetts but has no money; he freely dips into the inventory. He resents his life, maintaining that he was tricked into buying the pub, weaseled out of his fortune and status in Ireland by the damn Yankees here in the United States. His steadfast wife Nora (Kate Forbes) dotes on him despite the ire he shoots her way. Their daughter Sara (Belle Aykroyd), however, taunts her Byron-quoting father, who boasts of the one valiant battle he fought — Talavera, he declares again and again, with a loving roll of the tongue. Meanwhile Sara nurses an unseen sick guest upstairs, a gentleman Yankee who is also afflicted with the touch of the poet, though more of the transcendentalist variety. She is in love with her Thoreau, who scribbles poems in a cabin by a lake, but their courtship is complicated by her father and their families’ difference in status. Ciarán O’Reilly’s assiduous direction of the lengthy production effectively captures how egos clash over one day in this tight setting. The lead roles are challenging; Cuccioli has the pretentious, stiff-backed pageantry and the distant look of nostalgia in his eyes, but occasionally labors through Con’s lightning-fast changes in temperament. Aykroyd’s Sara matches Con’s boasts with scathing ridicule and her own highhanded sense of self-worth, but Aykroyd is not always as effective conveying her character’s veiled affections. Forbes’s Nora is the rock of the play — loyal to a fault but also kicked aside. She slouches through the virtual bar, fussing and tending to Con while he spits vitriol; still, she delivers O’Neill’s language in a singing Irish brogue that’s its own poetry. Admirably, O’Reilly has mounted a production with such chemistry and pep that it stands as a reminder of those pre-pandemic theater days of yore. It is a marvel to see actors not in Zoom boxes but seeming to share the same space, with a gaggle of Irishmen loudly getting sloshed in the background. And it’s not just pixelated heads floating against a digital backdrop. We see the actors’ full bodies as they enter and exit the family pub. All the better to take in Charlie Corcoran’s beautifully detailed bar setting and Alejo Vietti’s handsome costume design, from Nora’s peasant attire to Con’s foppish threads. Sarah Nichols’s video editing, however, sometimes does a disservice to the proceedings. The abrupt cuts — especially during scenes depicting conversations between two characters, which rapidly switch between landscape and speaker views — can be distracting. O’Neill, the verbose old devil, gets too gabby in the last two acts, over-explaining through the dialogue, with the self-righteous Sara his particular mouthpiece. But it’s forgivable given how well Cuccioli handles Con’s final scenes, after a confrontation leaves him irrevocably changed. After all, when Con first appears, dressed in dusty shades of purple like a retired royal, we already know he’s our Byronic hero. But O’Neill won’t allow us to romanticize this man, whose measure of himself is always foremost on his mind. One interesting aspect of watching “Touch of the Poet” right now: As the Melody family reckons with their regrets and resentments, an election is happening in the background. Andrew Jackson, “idol of the riffraff,” the “contemptible, drunken scoundrel,” as Con calls him early on, is about to become the next president. By the end, Con is cheering for Jackson, too. Delusions of entitlement versus faith in reason: How striking to watch a work that O’Neill wrote about another American election season speak so forcefully to our own. "
57,'Roadkill' Review: Hugh Laurie Is a Politician Trying to Avoid Cancellation,"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 16:58:09 +0000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/arts/television/roadkill-review.html,Mike Hale,"Need to lend some charm, suavity and wry humanity to an otherwise objectionable middle-aged British male? Hugh Laurie is your man, filling that neo-George Sanders role in characters both mildly vainglorious (the spaceship captain of “Avenue 5”) and utterly despicable (the arms dealer of “The Night Manager”). His latest, in the BBC mini-series “Roadkill” (beginning Sunday on PBS’s “Masterpiece”), falls somewhere in between, and trying to guess exactly where is our primary sport across the show’s four episodes. Peter Laurence may be a well-meaning, if destructively narcissistic, politician with a libertarian bent; he may be a soulless monster who doesn’t care about the bodies he leaves behind, perhaps literally, as he claws his way up the government. Laurie’s guarded, superbly understated performance keeps alive to the last moment the possibility that either, or both, might be true. “Roadkill” was written by the British playwright David Hare, whose work — “Plenty,” “Via Dolorosa,” “Stuff Happens” — has always had a strong political component. In Britain, where it premiered two weeks ago, the show has been received and evaluated as a commentary on the ascendant Conservative Party, to which the fictional Laurence and his nemesis, an old-school prime minister (Helen McCrory), belong. American viewers will make their own association. Laurence is a populist who sold furniture and real estate before becoming a member of Parliament; he rails against the political establishment while, behind the scenes, power brokers profit from the “turbulence” he causes. “You can get away with anything if you just brazen it out,” he says. And he also says, “People like me because I break the rules.” The parallels to Donald Trump feel unmistakable. Laurence is much smoother and more concerned with putting on a show of concern, however. And crucially, his true motives aren’t on the surface, which is what makes it possible for “Roadkill” to be a drama rather than the kind of bald caricature that seems to be the only workable response to Trump. “Roadkill” has elements of political satire and conspiracy thriller, but its dominant mode is a kind of melancholy, slow-moving farce. (Michael Keillor, a TV veteran whose credits encompass the soap opera “EastEnders” and the roller-coaster cop drama “Line of Duty,” directed all four episodes.) The series opens as Laurence wins a 1.5-million-pound judgment against a newspaper that accused him of corruption when he was health minister, before his current gig atop the transportation ministry. The victory boosts his populist appeal, but a cascade of potentially career-ending crises immediately ensues. Hare populates the story with a long string of women who could trip up Laurence in one way or another, from the acerbic prime minister to the reporter whose career he ruined (Sarah Greene of “Dublin Murders”), his angry daughter (Millie Brady), his mistress (Sidse Babett Knudsen, star of “Borgen”), his disgruntled driver (Emma Cunniffe) and his lawyer (Pippa Bennett-Warner of “Gangs of London”), who wouldn’t be shocked to find out her client lied. Topping his list of female problems, though, is the anonymous inmate of a London prison who claims to be his unknown daughter. As an increasingly frantic Laurence juggles his personal and political challenges, Hare deftly weaves the strands together, and the later episodes offer satisfying moments of congruence and payback. Laurence has a genius for dancing above the chaos, though, and as he fails upward, what is comic in form can feel tragic in substance — or at least unresolved and menacing. However many human obstacles Hare throws in Laurence’s way, they all have a tendency to end up as collateral damage. Laurie dominates the screen time and defines the mood, but he’s helped by a deep bench of old pros, including the razor-sharp McCrory, Pip Torrens as the newspaper’s editor and Patricia Hodge as its owner and Saskia Reeves as Laurence’s choir-director wife, who seems out of her depth but possesses unsuspected layers of cunning. Not every detail of the series’s social and political intrigue makes sense, especially with regard to the newspaper business. (Would even a Fleet Street rag go big with a story based on a reporter’s hearsay account of a diary she can’t produce?) The human side of the equation mostly adds up, though, and Laurie nails the contradictions of Laurence, who tries kindness on for size but only to see whether it fits with his consuming ambition. As Laurence tests spins on whoever happens to be in front of him, or struggles to control his glee as the prime minister dangles a promotion, Laurie wholly inhabits a man who’s all too comfortable in his own skin.
