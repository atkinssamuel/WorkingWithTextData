John Kennedy, R-La., told ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"" Monday.  ""The American people elected him as an insult to the political elite in Washington, D.C.,"" Kennedy told host Tucker Carlson. ""I think the American people also elected him because he never talked down to them."" Carlson had opened his program by marveling at the turnout for a Saturday night Trump rally in Butler, Pa., one of four events the president held in the Keystone State that day.  ""I'm just amazed by these photographs,"" Carlson told Kennedy, ""not because they portend certain electoral results but because they are so against what everybody in the world I live in believes."" TUCKER CARLSON: WHY DONALD TRUMP'S SUPPORTERS LOVE HIM SO MUCH The host then asked Kennedy how, if the elites and people in wealthier areas find Trump ""evil,"" why millions continue to come out to support the president. ""If I had to put it another way, and this statement I think crosses party lines,"" Kennedy stated, ""many, many Americans -- both Democrats and Republicans -- look at the leadership in Washington, D.C., on both sides of the aisle including the bureaucracy, and they wonder how we made it through the birth canal."" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Kennedy added that Trump represents a Republican Party more interested in helping people by giving them a ""hand up"" as opposed to liberal Democrats seeking to give a ""handout."" ""My Democratic friends want to see a society of safety nets where no one has to take responsibility [and] where it's always somebody else's fault [and] where every child gets a trophy,"" he said. ""Republicans reject that.""

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment. EXCLUSIVE: Olivia Newton-John, a longtime advocate for the advancement of cancer research, is once again using her platform to bring awareness and funding to the enormous cause.   Three times in nearly 30 years, the “Grease” actress and singer, 72, has battled cancer. Throughout her journey, she has been on a quest for a cure, but now Newton-John is compelled to throw her reach at cancer in a big way following the death of close pal Kelly Preston. Preston, who was married to John Travolta, died in July at age 57 after a private two-year bout with breast cancer. “John is my friend and he chooses to be private about this but he's doing as well as anyone can be after losing their wife,” Newton-John, who starred alongside Travolta in ""Grease"" and “Two of a Kind,” told Fox News. “Kelly, she was the most wonderful, beautiful, radiant mother and woman and losing her is incredibly sad.” KELLY PRESTON: JOHN TRAVOLTA'S 'GREASE' CO-STAR OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN SAYS HER 'HEART BREAKS' OVER THE LOSS Travolta announced the heartbreaking news of Preston’s death in an Instagram post at the time.

       ""Kelly’s love and life will always be remembered,"" he wrote in part. ""I will be taking some time to be there for my children who have lost their mother, so forgive me in advance if you don’t hear from us for a while. But please know that I will feel your outpouring of love in the weeks and months ahead as we heal."" JOHN TRAVOLTA PRAISES ‘GREASE’ CO-STAR OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN AMID HER CANCER BATTLE: ‘I’M VERY PROUD OF HER’ Meanwhile, the British-Australian performer said launching the Olivia Newton-John Foundation is her vehicle to make a real impact in the ongoing fight against cancer. “It really strengthens my resolve to do what I'm doing so I can find other ways to treat cancer,” Newton-John said of Preston’s death. “We all want to see an end to it. So that's going to keep me going.” OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN TEARFULLY TALKS BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS: ‘I KNEW IMMEDIATELY SOMETHING WAS WRONG’ The “A Little More Love” singer was first diagnosed with the disease in 1992, had a secret battle with cancer in 2013 and her most recent diagnosis in 2017.

       Through her independent charity, Newton-John will be auctioning off over 300 items including two Zoom chats with fans, memorabilia, awards, artwork and more with Julien’s Auctions via an online-only bidding auction beginning on Nov. 9 and ending on Nov. 30. JOHN TRAVOLTA ON REUNITING WITH OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN: 'WE LOVE EACH OTHER' All of the proceeds raised go directly to the organization and their efforts to combat cancer. “That’s my dream. That’s my goal – to find different kinds of therapy for cancer and to see if we can get to a point where we can control cancer and live with it, like diabetes and other conditions,” Newton-John said. HOW KELLY PRESTON SPENT HER FINAL YEARS WHILE PRIVATELY BATTLING CANCER “Immunotherapy is showing some promise, but ultimately we want to find treatments that don’t poison the body,” she added.

       Newton-John maintained that she’s especially excited for whoever ends up winning the Zoom calls with her. The event marks the second time she’s been willing to auction off her keepsakes and made it a point to shout out to a “wonderful man” who previously ended up placing a winning bid on her “Grease” jacket, only to gift it back to Newton-John.

I want everybody to vote, but I’m not a huge fan of adjusting everybody’s schedule and having national election day,” Leach said. “Everybody should vote but I don’t think they should cancel practice that day as a result because we’re in school and everybody is going to work and everybody is responsible enough to go vote. “Worst yet, they’re going to do it every year and next year our elections in the state of Mississippi don’t even line up with that date. Anyway, we move forward and look forward to practicing this afternoon.” Leach said he was “disappointed” in anyone who doesn’t vote. “I would say that some (are) enthusiastic. Generally, the best description would be curious and interested on doing something they haven’t done before. I definitely think it’s positive because one of the things that we do in this country is too many people sit on their hands and aren’t as active in government. The lowest rung on the ladder is ‘go vote’ so I think everybody should. I think it’s a good thing that schools around the country are educating people on that and it’s long overdue,” he added.

Butler is a town 35 miles north of Pittsburgh, and it's like a lot of places you'll find in this country once you head inland from the coasts. Butler is a former industrial town -- they made Pullman rail cars there for many years -- but it's been losing population for decades. There are still a lot of nice people in Butler and for $60,000 or so, you can buy a decent house there. It's a place you might be happy in. But our professional class is not impressed by Butler. They don't consider Butler, Pa. or places like it to be the future. To them, places like Butler are embarrassing relics of a past best forgotten. The men of Butler may have built this country, and they did, but they mean nothing to our leaders now. You can be certain of that because when large numbers of people in Butler started killing themselves with narcotics, no one in Washington or New York or Los Angeles said a word about it.

      (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) There have now been so many opioid deaths in Butler that a few years ago, residents built an overdose memorial in the middle of town. MSNBC didn't cover that. So given all of that, it was interesting how the people around Butler feel about Donald Trump. Between 10,000 and 15,000 people came out to see him Saturday night, depending on whose estimate you believe. Pictures of the rally site showed a sea of people obscuring the horizon, the kind of image you would see of a visit from the pope. When was the last time a political speech drew that many people? Well, the media didn't ask. Instead, they attacked the rally as a ""superspreader"" event. OK, we'll leave the epidemiology to CNN. But the questions still hung in the air. Why did all those people come? They must have known that Donald Trump is the most evil man who hass ever lived. They've heard that every day for five years. They know that people who support Donald Trump are also evil, they're bigots, they're morons, they're racist cult members. They know that Americans have been fired from their jobs for supporting Donald Trump, not to mention kicked off social media, belittled by their kids' teachers and shunned by decent society. Only losers and freaks support Donald Trump. TRUMP CLAIMS BIDEN ENERGY AGENDA WOULD 'SEND EVERY STATE INTO CRUSHING POVERTY"" People in Butler knew all of that. But on Saturday, they went to the Donald Trump rally, anyway. Why exactly did they do that? We should be pondering that question deeply as we watch Tuesday night's returns and as we live through the aftermath of them. Millions of Americans sincerely love Donald Trump. They love him in spite of everything they've heard. They love him, often, in spite of himself. They're not deluded. They know exactly who Trump is. They love him any way.

      (AP Photo/Keith Srakocic) They love Donald Trump because no one else loves them. The country they built, the country their ancestors fought for over hundreds of years, has left them to die in unfashionable little towns, mocked and despised by the sneering halfwits with finance degrees -- but no actual skills -- who seem to run everything all of a sudden. Whatever Donald Trump's faults, he is better than the rest of the people in charge. At least he doesn't hate them for their weakness. Donald Trump, in other words, is and has always been a living indictment of the people who run this country. That was true four years ago when he came out of nowhere to win the presidency. And it's every bit as true right now, maybe even more true than it's ever been. It will remain true regardless of whether Donald Trump wins reelection. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Trump rose because they failed. It's as simple as that. If the people in charge had done a halfway decent job with the country they inherited, if they cared about anything other than themselves, even for just a moment, Donald Trump would still be hosting ""Celebrity Apprentice."" But they didn't. Instead, they were incompetent and narcissistic and cruel and relentlessly dishonest. They wrecked what they didn't build, and they lied about it. They hurt anyone who told the truth about what they were doing. That's all true. We all watched. America is still a great country, the best in the world, but our ruling class is disgusting. A vote for Trump is a vote against them. That's what's going on in those pictures from Butler. That's what's going on in this country. "
