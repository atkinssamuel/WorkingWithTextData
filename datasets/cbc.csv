Premier Brian Pallister said at a news conference Monday that ""late-night situations"" in the Winnipeg region, a coronavirus hot spot, has significantly caused an ""expansion"" of cases.  He told reporters he's discussed the curfew as an option to mitigate larger gatherings with Dr. Brent Roussin, Manitoba's chief public health officer. ""According to Dr. Roussin, this is an action that we should seriously consider, and I am seriously considering it now,"" the premier said  Pallister discussed the possible new health restrictions as the Winnipeg region is entering the first day of following new rules under its red alert status. Movie theatres, libraries, sports facilities, restaurants, bars and dining rooms are closed for at least two weeks. The rest of the province is under the orange level. Over in the United States, the government's top infectious diseases expert is cautioning that the country will have to deal with ""a whole lot of hurt"" in the weeks ahead due to surging coronavirus cases. Dr. Anthony Fauci's comments to the Washington Post take issue with President Donald Trump's frequent assertion that the nation is ""rounding the turn"" on the virus.   Fauci said the U.S. ""could not possibly be positioned more poorly"" to stem rising cases as more people gather indoors during the colder fall and winter months. He said the U.S. will need to make an ""abrupt change"" in public health precautions. Speaking of the risks, Fauci said he believes Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden ""is taking it seriously from a public health perspective,"" while Trump is ""looking at it from a different perspective."" Fauci, who's on the White House coronavirus task force, said that perspective is ""the economy and reopening the country."" White House spokesperson Judd Deere said in response that Trump always puts people's well-being first, and Deere charged that Fauci has decided ""to play politics"" right before Tuesday's election. Fauci has said in his decades of public service he's never publicly endorsed any political candidate. WATCH | Trump supporters chant 'fire Fauci' at Florida rally: The president touched on Fauci's service in the early morning hours on Monday as he spoke at a campaign rally in Florida. Trump expressed frustration that the surging cases of the virus that has killed more than 231,000 people in the U.S. this year remains prominent in the news, sparking chants of ""fire Fauci"" from his supporters. ""Don't tell anybody but let me wait until a little bit after the election,"" Trump replied to thousands of supporters early Monday, adding he appreciated their ""advice."" Speaking at a rally on Monday, Biden again lambasted Trump and his record on COVID-19, saying he would do more to slow the spread of the virus, of which there have been more than 9.2 million cases in the U.S. alone. ""The first step to beating the virus is beating Donald Trump,"" he said during a drive-in rally in Cleveland. The head of the World Health Organization said he has been identified as a contact of a person who tested positive for COVID-19 and will self-quarantine. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus wrote on Twitter late Sunday that he is ""well and without symptoms"" but will self-quarantine in ""coming days, in line with WHO protocols, and work from home."" Speaking from home, Tedros said on Monday that a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in some countries in Europe and North America presented leaders with a ""critical moment for action."" The WHO director general has been at the forefront of the global response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected at least 46.5 million people and led to more than 1.2 million deaths, according to a count of confirmed cases by Johns Hopkins University. Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on the COVID-19 pandemic, also said Monday that there's been no COVID-19 transmission or clusters at the agency's Geneva headquarters. In Europe, several countries are tightening restrictions this week, starting with a partial shutdown Monday in Germany, as authorities across the continent scramble to slow a rapid rise in coronavirus infections that threatens to overwhelm their health-care systems. Britain and Austria will follow suit later in the week, closing restaurants, bars and non-essential shops. Italy, Greece and Kosovo also announced new measures. In some places, the new rules — which vary in strictness — are prompting violent protests by people frustrated at once again having to forgo freedoms. But in many, experts are saying they should have come weeks ago — a reflection of the increasingly difficult balance many countries are struggling to strike between controlling the virus and boosting already damaged economies. ""We are aware of the frustration, the sense of loss, the tiredness of citizens, also of the anger which is being manifested in these days, by citizens who find themselves living with new limits to their personal freedom,"" said Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte, as he defended his government's decision to order new measures. In Paris, health authorities reported 52,518 new COVID-19 infections in the last day, the highest daily numbers since the country began widespread testing. Patients with the virus now make up 70 per cent of France's intensive care units.  On Friday, France ordered all residents to stay home and shuttered non-essential businesses, while leaving schools open in a bid to curb staggering COVID-19 case numbers.  Restaurants, bars, theatres, cinemas, gyms and other leisure facilities are closed in a four-week ""wave-breaker"" shutdown starting in Germany. Germans have also been asked not to travel, and hotels are being barred from accepting tourists.  ​​​​​In the Americas, coronavirus cases continued their grim climb in the United States on Sunday, with Midwestern states experiencing record hospitalizations. The U.S. is continuing to break records with its number of infections, as the number of new cases has risen each week for four weeks straight, with the largest increases occurring over the last two weeks. The number of new deaths also increased by three per cent last week.  Hospitals across the U.S. are competing for nurses, especially in rural areas or smaller facilities that are facing a shortage.  Nurse burnout from dealing with months of the pandemic response is also becoming a concern, as it has led some to quit the profession.  Experienced nurses are ""burned out with this whole [pandemic],"" said Kevin Fitzpatrick, an emergency room nurse at Hurley Medical Center in Flint, Mich., where several left just in the past month to work in hospice or home care or at outpatient clinics. As a result, he said, the ER is operating at about five nurses short of its optimal level at any given time, and each one typically cares for four patients as COVID-19 hospitalizations surge anew.  The Brazilian health minister, who is ill with COVID-19, was to stay in a military hospital overnight on Sunday, after having been discharged from a civilian facility earlier in the day. Brazil also reported an additional 8,501 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the last day, along with 179 deaths, the Health Ministry said Monday. The death toll in the South American country has reached 160,253, according to ministry data, which makes it the most fatal outbreak in the world other than the U.S.  In the Asia-Pacific region, India recorded 45,231 new infections, taking total cases there to 8.23 million. South Korea said it will expand its mandatory mask policy to spas, wedding halls and other places as part of new physical distancing rules. In the Middle East, Iran's daily tally of coronavirus deaths hit a record high of 434 on Sunday. South Africa remains the hardest-hit country in Africa, with more than 726,000 cases reported since the outbreak began and more than 19,400 reported deaths. WATCH | ICU beds were doubled in Johannesburg due to lack of care specialists: As of 7:30 p.m. EST Monday, provinces and territories in Canada had reported a cumulative total of 240,263 confirmed or presumptive coronavirus cases. Provinces and territories listed 200,052 as recovered or resolved. A CBC News tally of deaths based on provincial reports, regional health information and CBC's reporting stood at 10,208. Ontario reported 948 new COVID-19 cases, with 315 in Toronto, 269 in Peel Region, 81 in York Region and 64 in Ottawa. The province, which as of Monday reported 350 cases in hospital with 72 in ICU, also announced seven new deaths. The seven-day average is also at an all-time high, reaching 919 cases per day overall. Monday's numbers come as Premier Doug Ford announced the government will commit to a new standard that will provide long-term care residents with an average of four hours of direct care per day. Ford said the previous average was 2.75 hours. To achieve this standard, thousands of workers will need to be hired, and that initiative will begin ""in earnest, right now,"" said Ford.  Ford also said Monday that health officials are working on a reopening plan that will go in front of his cabinet as soon as today. A 28-day period of tighter health restrictions including the shutdown of indoor dining in Toronto, Ottawa and Peel expires at the end of this week. The same rules introduced in York Region expire one week later.  The premier also addressed Rexall temporarily pausing flu shots as it says its pharmacies have been facing shortages. Ford told the company not to overbook, saying the company knew how many flu shots it had to give out. WATCH | Ontario premier tells Rexall pharmacies not to overbook flu shots: After Ford's statements that he's been listening to health experts and small businesses owners about what's possible, Toronto Mayor John Tory issued a letter agreeing with the premier. Other Greater Toronto Region mayors also co-signed the letter. Dr. Eileen De Villa, the Toronto's chief medical officer, said at a news conference Monday that it seems that the city's numbers are plateauing, but they aren't where she'd like to see them. The stabilizing of the number of new infections is something Toronto residents need to strive to protect, as the city continues to be a COVID-19 hot spot, she said.  Concerns over private gatherings continue as officials at Western University said they are ""troubled"" after a large Halloween party was held by students over the weekend. London police confirmed that around 150 people attended a house party and they are investigating.  Two Quebec regions — Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and Chaudière-Appalaches — are moving into Quebec's highest state of alert for COVID-19, joining Quebec City, Montreal, Laval and several other regions labelled ""red zones"" by the province.  Tracking the second wave: Your guide to Quebec's latest COVID-19 data  Quebec, which has seen the most cases of any province or territory, on Monday reported 1,037 new COVID-19 cases. According to a COVID-19 tracking tool maintained by Quebec health officials, there were 499 people hospitalized, with 81 in ICU. In Manitoba, health officials reported 241 new cases of the virus Monday, along with four new deaths connected to outbreaks at St. Boniface Hospital and personal care homes. At a news conference, Dr. Brett Roussin announced new self-isolation rules for people in the Winnipeg region who are in quarantine due to possible COVID-19 exposure. Now, if any member of a household has COVID-19 symptoms, all those living in the home must also self-isolate, he said. WATCH | Manitoba doctors warn of dire situation in hospitals: The person experiencing the symptoms must stay in their own room and not use common areas, if possible.  Doctors in Manitoba have also issued an open letter to the premier, stating that the province is in ""grave peril"" and calling on emergency funding to be used to combat the spike in COVID-19 infections. More than 200 doctors signed the letter, stating that the COVID-19 response from the government needs to be faster and more aggressive.  Saskatchewan reported 74 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday. Of the province's total 3,292 reported cases, 858 are considered active. Currently, 34 people are hospitalized with the virus.  British Columbia announced an unprecedented number of new cases on Monday, with 1,120 reported over the weekend, as well as with six new deaths.  Deputy Provincial Health Officer Dr. Réka Gustafson disclosed the new numbers late Monday afternoon, saying that there are now 2,945 active cases in the province. The new cases confirmed are the highest B.C. has seen during the pandemic, with 352 from Friday to Saturday, 389 from Saturday to Sunday and 379 from Sunday to Monday. ""These numbers are concerning to all of us, but we have learned a lot about COVID-19 since the beginning of the pandemic,"" Gustafson said. The province's goals are to minimize severe illness while allowing communities to be as open as possible, she said. Provincial Health Minister Adrian Dix had warned residents earlier on Monday that the latest numbers would be attention-grabbing. Dix was irritated about the hundreds of people shown on social media crowding Granville Street for Halloween festivities.  He called the event ""a visible symbol of people not following the rules of gathering, which are limited to 50 people."" The president of the Alberta Prison Justice Society on Monday called for action as a massive outbreak at the Calgary Correctional Centre has led to two-thirds of inmates testing positive.  Amanda Hart-Dowhun said, in an open letter to provincial Justice Minister Kaycee Madu and others, that drastic action needs to be taken to uphold the human rights of the inmates and keep them safe against the virus. This could require releasing inmates temporarily into the community, she said.  Nova Scotia reported two new COVID-19 cases on Monday, saying the new cases were related to travel outside Atlantic Canada.  In New Brunswick, there were no new cases reported on Monday. There were no new cases reported on Sunday in Newfoundland and Labrador or Prince Edward Island, which has no active cases.  There were no new cases reported in Yukon, the Northwest Territories or Nunavut over the weekend. The federal government also announced on Monday evening new rules for travellers to Canada. All travellers are now required to submit their information, including their quarantine plan, electronically through the ArriveCAN system prior to boarding a plane into the country. Those who fail to submit the information before reaching the border could face a fine of up to $1,000, the government said in a news release.  "
1,"Police hunt for gunmen after Vienna rocked by attack that leaves 3 dead, including 1 shooter","Mon, 2 Nov 2020 15:13:46 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/vienna-synagogue-shooting-1.5786658?cmp=rss,The Associated Press,"Gunmen attacked six locations in central Vienna on Monday starting outside the main synagogue, killing two people and injuring at least 14 in what Austrian authorities called a ""repulsive terror attack."" Police said they were hunting one or more assailants still on the loose. Witnesses described the men firing into crowds in bars with automatic rifles as many people took advantage of the last evening before a nationwide COVID-19 curfew was to take effect. Police shot and killed one assailant and sealed off much of the historic centre of Vienna, urging the public to shelter in place. Many people sought refuge in bars and hotels while public transport throughout the old town was shut down and police scoured the city. ""We are victims of a despicable terror attack in the federal capital that is still ongoing,"" Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said hours after the gunfire erupted. ""One of the perpetrators was neutralized, but several perpetrators appear to still be on the loose,"" he said. ""They seem to also, as far as we know, be very well equipped with automatic weapons. So they were very well prepared. It's definitely a terror attack."" Police said that several shots were fired shortly after 8 p.m. local time on a lively street in the city centre and that there were six shooting locations. Unverified footage posted on social media showed gunmen walking through the streets, apparently shooting at random and wounding several people. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer told public broadcaster ORF that the army had been asked to guard key locations in the city to allow police to pursue the gunmen. ""At the moment, I can confirm we believe this is an apparent terror attack,"" he said. Kurz praised police for killing one of the attackers and vowed: ""We will not ever allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism and will fight these attacks with all means."" Authorities gave no indication of the identity of the assailants or the reason for the attack. WATCH | Unclear whether attack specifically targeted synagogue, reporter in Vienna tells CBC News: President Emmanuel Macron of France, which has seen two deadly knife attacks in Paris and Nice in recent weeks, issued a statement expressing shock and sorrow. ""This is our Europe,"" he said. ""Our enemies must know with whom they are dealing. We will not retreat."" French officials have ramped up security after the attacks in Paris and Nice, which had suspected Islamist motives. Macron has deployed thousands of soldiers to protect sites such as places of worship and schools, and ministers have warned that other Islamist militant attacks could take place. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau condemned the attack in a message posted to Twitter, calling it ""horrific.""  Today’s shooting in Vienna is horrific and heartbreaking. We condemn in the strongest terms possible this act of terrorism. Our thoughts are with the people of Austria and everyone affected by this deplorable act. Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch said on Twitter that it was not clear whether the Vienna synagogue and adjoining offices had been the target of an attack, and said they were closed at the time. Rabbi Schlomo Hofmeister told The Associated Press that he saw at least one person fire shots at people sitting outside bars in the street below his window. ""They were shooting at least 100 rounds just outside our building,"" Hofmeister said. ""All these bars have tables outside. This evening is the last evening before the lockdown. As of midnight, all bars and restaurants will be closed in Austria for the next month and a lot of people probably wanted to use that evening to be able to go out."" Kurz said these were ""difficult hours for our republic"" and vowed: ""Our police will act decisively against the culprits of this despicable terror attack."" Videos circulated on social media of a gunman running down a cobblestone street shooting and shouting. Reuters could not immediately verify the videos. Vienna police urged people not to share videos and photos via social media. ""This jeopardizes police forces as well as the civilian population,"" they said on Twitter. In 1981, two people were killed and 18 injured during an attack by two Palestinians at the same synagogue. In 1985, a Palestinian extremist group attacked Vienna airport with hand grenades and assault rifles, killing three civilians. In recent years, Austria has been spared the sort of large-scale attacks seen in Paris, Berlin and London. In August, authorities arrested a 31-year-old Syrian refugee suspected of trying to attack a Jewish community leader in the city of Graz. The leader was unhurt. "
2,"Trump, Biden make final appeals to voters in key states ahead of election day","Sat, 19 Oct 2019 12:37:24 EDT",https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/trump-biden-last-day-campaign-1.5786141?cmp=rss,,"With early voter turnout setting a record and U.S. business districts boarding up for fear of election day unrest, U.S. President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden stumped on the campaign's last day on Monday in states expected to decide who wins. More than 95 million people have already voted, according to a tally from the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida, and it could take longer than usual for elections officials to process the historic surge in early and mail-in ballots. Both campaigns insist they have a pathway to victory, though Biden's options for picking up the required 270 electoral college votes are more plentiful. Trump is banking on a surge of enthusiasm from his most loyal supporters while also threatening legal action to stop vote counting in some crucial states, including Pennsylvania. The Republican president's final day had him sprinting through five rallies, beginning with stops in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, followed by visits to Wisconsin and Michigan. He told supporters at the Fayetteville, N.C., rally that ""we're going to win anyway"" despite investigations he said were launched as part of an attempted takedown. Trump was referring to the special counsel's investigation into ties between his 2016 presidential campaign and Russia and his impeachment by the Democratic-run House. WATCH | Canadian government plans for U.S. election results: Biden began his day at a drive-in rally at an airplane hangar in Cleveland. Ohio is a perennial swing state, and no Republican has won the presidency without it. While Trump won it by about eight percentage points in 2016, Biden`s aides believe he has a shot here because of his appeal to blue-collar workers and suburban voters in the state. Biden, looking to boost his blue-collar bona fides, said Trump ""sees the world from Park Avenue,"" but ""Wall Street didn't build America — the middle class built America!"" The Democrat also spoke about manufacturing jobs lost in Ohio and his plan to boost those jobs by incentivizing companies and the federal government to make more products in the U.S. Biden devoted most of his time Monday to Pennsylvania, where a win would leave Trump with an exceedingly narrow path. Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris, speaking at a rally in northeastern Pennsylvania, said if she and Biden win the White House, ""we will probably have the most pro-labour administration we've seen in a long time."" ""Pennsylvania's gonna determine the outcome of this election,"" Harris said in Luzerne County, a region that was once a major hub of anthracite coal mining and backed Trump in 2016 after previously supporting Barack Obama. Obama, meanwhile, campaigned in Georgia as Democrats pushed into another formerly reliable Republican stronghold. ""Georgia could be the state, Georgia could be the place,"" the former president said. Biden also announced plans to campaign in Scranton, Pa., and Philadelphia on Tuesday as part of a get-out-the-vote effort. Harris will visit Detroit, a heavily Black city in battleground Michigan, and both of their spouses will hit the road too. Trump, at least for now, was not scheduled to travel on election day. Twitter said on Monday it would attach a warning label to any tweets, including those from candidates, that claim an election win before either state election officials or national news outlets do so. In a sign of how volatile the election could be, buildings in several cities were boarded up, including along several blocks around the White House and in New York City including the iconic Macy's flagship. The famed shopping destination of Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif., will be closed down on Tuesday, police said. Federal authorities planned to extend the perimeter fencing around the White House by several blocks, encompassing the same area fenced out during this summer's protests against racism and police brutality, according to U.S. media. The FBI was investigating an incident in Texas when a pro-Trump convoy of vehicles surrounded a tour bus carrying Biden campaign staff. The caravan, which Trump praised, prompted the Biden campaign to cancel at least two of its Texas events, as Democrats accused the president of encouraging supporters to engage in acts of intimidation. Eight state attorneys general — representing Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — warned on Monday that they would not tolerate voter intimidation. ""Voter intimidation is illegal in every state, whether it happens in person or from a car,"" North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein said in a statement. ""People who witness concerning behaviour should immediately report it to law enforcement authorities."" As the candidates close out the campaign, the pandemic, which has killed more than 231,000 people in the U.S. and caused nearly 20 million to lose jobs, reached a new peak in infection rates, threatening yet another blow to lives and the livelihoods of voters. Biden defended Dr. Anthony Fauci on Monday after Trump suggested Sunday night he'd dismiss the nation's top infectious disease expert after election day. During a rally in Opa-locka, Fla., the president expressed frustration that the surging virus cases remain prominent in the news, sparking chants of ""Fire Fauci"" from his supporters. Trump replied, ""Don't tell anybody, but let me wait until a little bit after the election."" In response, Biden defended Fauci in Cleveland and said said the first step for the U.S. to defeat the coronavirus ""is [by] beating Donald Trump."" Biden has sought to keep the presidential campaign focused on the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic, while Trump has used the race's final hours to accuse Biden of wanting to force the country back into a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus. WATCH | Biden defends Fauci at Cleveland rally: The election caps an extraordinary year that began with Trump's impeachment and the near-collapse of Biden's candidacy during the crowded Democratic primary, and then was fully reshaped by the coronavirus outbreak. A record number of votes have already been cast, through early voting or mail-in ballots, which could lead to delays in their tabulation. Trump has spent months claiming without evidence that the votes would be ripe for fraud while refusing to guarantee that he would honour the election result. After the president threatened legal action on Sunday to stop vote counting in some crucial states such as Pennsylvania, his campaign released a statement on Monday accusing Democrats of trying to ""subvert state deadlines for receiving and counting ballots."" If Pennsylvania ballot counting takes several days, as is allowed, Trump charged on Monday that ""cheating can happen like you have never seen."" WATCH | U.S. election brings potential for violence, think-tank warns: Trump's deputy campaign manager, Justin Clark, said the campaign would fight any Democratic attempt to ""subvert state deadlines for receiving and counting ballots."" In response, Biden campaign manager Jennifer O'Malley Dillon reminded reporters on Monday that states routinely needed time after election night to finish counting votes in past U.S. elections. ""Under no scenario will Donald Trump be declared a victor on election night,"" she said. There is already an appeal pending at the Supreme Court over the counting of absentee ballots in Pennsylvania that are received in the mail in the three days after the election. The state's top court ordered the extension and the Supreme Court refused to block it, though conservative justices expressed interest in taking up the propriety of the three added days after the election. Those ballots are being kept separate in case the litigation goes forward. The issue could assume enormous importance if the late-arriving ballots could tip the outcome. In Nevada, another battleground state, a judge ruled that ballot-counting measures in Clark County — the state's largest and home to Las Vegas — were legal, a setback to Trump and Republican officials.  The suit filed by Trump's campaign, the state's Republican Party and an individual voter claimed the counting process in Clark County was plagued by several issues, including observers not being able to get to where they needed to observe the count and ballots being handled in a way observers deemed improper. Judge James Wilson said the plaintiffs in the case did not have legal standing to bring the case and had not provided evidence that the county's processes had led to the counting of fraudulent votes, in a ruling issued on Thursday but released on Monday. WATCH | Texas in play ahead of U.S. election: Meanwhile, a federal judge in Texas rejected a Republican bid to throw out about 127,000 votes already cast in the U.S. presidential election at drive-thru voting sites in the state's largest county. Harris County, home to Houston — a Democratic-leaning area — and about 4.7 million people, is the third most populous county in the U.S. It currently has 10 drive-thru polling sites, which are available to all voters. The Texas Supreme Court on Sunday rejected a nearly identical bid by the same plaintiffs to halt drive-thru voting in Harris County. The same court also previously denied similar challenges brought by the Texas Republican Party and the Harris County Republican Party. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen said earlier on Monday that the Republicans who brought the case faced an ""uphill road"" in convincing him that votes cast at drive-thru voting sites should be voided.

3,"Secrecy, conflicts in Collingwood deals point to holes in Ontario's integrity rules, judge finds","Mon, 2 Nov 2020 21:36:15 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/collingwood-inquiry-marrocco-report-conflict-of-interest-1.5787201?cmp=rss,CBC News,"A tangle of insider relationships among officials and family in the resort town of Collingwood, Ont., led to serious problems in two multimillion-dollar public contracts, a judge concluded today after a two-year public inquiry, pointing to the need for the province to plug holes in its laws around municipal politicians' conflicts of interest. The 306 recommendations from Judge Frank Marrocco include a call to overhaul Ontario's Municipal Conflict of Interest Act. The judge said elected officials should be barred from participating and voting on many matters in which extended family such as siblings are involved — a much bigger circle than in current rules. It's also something already recommended nine years ago but not acted on, after an inquiry into a municipal deal in another Ontario city. Another recommendation is to compel municipal councillors throughout Ontario to publicly declare their assets, income and debts, and any family involved in those financial interests every year — the same way provincial and federal politicians do. ""Unfair bidding practices, unfair procurement practices, conflicts of interest, inaccurate and misleading town council reports, the misuse and inappropriate disclosure of the town's confidential information,"" was how Marrocco described his findings Monday at a news conference releasing his 914-page report.  ""In other words, behaviours that, left unaddressed, undermines the foundational core and reputation of a municipal government."" Marrocco was tasked in 2018 with looking into two deals hatched in 2012 by the town of Collingwood, about 150 kilometres north of Toronto: the sale of half of the local electrical utility and the use of the proceeds to build a new arena and a domed roof over a community pool. Local officials asked for the inquiry after learning that, among other things, lobbyist Paul Bonwick, a former Liberal MP and brother of then-mayor Sandra Cooper, consulted for the winning bidder for the stake in the utility. CBC News later revealed that Bonwick also did undisclosed work for the construction company that built the domed roofs for the pool and arena.  In total, he earned nearly $1.1 million in fees from the deals. The Municipal Conflict of Interest Act, however, does not explicitly require politicians to recuse themselves on a matter in which their sibling is involved, so Cooper said she thought she was OK to debate and vote on the contracts. Bonwick was not only the mayor's brother but also a close family friend of then-deputy mayor Rick Lloyd. Bonwick also employed one of the town's councillors and was a sometime business associate of the town's acting top bureaucrat, Ed Houghton, the inquiry found.   The inquiry concluded Bonwick obtained confidential information about the electrical-utility sale from Lloyd and Houghton, ""including sensitive information about the other bidders' presentations,"" which he then passed on to his client. Bonwick told CBC News on Monday that he respectfully disagrees with many of the inquiry's conclusions that he had so far reviewed. ""I do not believe that the evidence provided during the hearing supported those findings,"" he said in a text message.  ""That said, I also believe we all have a responsibility to improve upon review of any dealings. At the end of the day, the municipality received exceptional value on both transactions.""  Reached Monday evening, Lloyd said he's been going through the inquiry documents to try to determine what exactly the ""sensitive information"" findings refer to, ""because nothing was ever released by me ever that would be confidential, that wouldn't be public[ly] available.… I don't think that's accurate at all."" Marrocco's inquiry also found that Houghton, in particular, had ""unusual influence and freedom"" within the town bureaucracy and unilaterally initiated talks to sell off part or all of the electricity utility without telling the mayor or council. Once it came to council's attention, Cooper and Lloyd ""ignored warnings"" from Collingwood's municipal lawyer that the town should seek independent legal advice about the sale.  Lloyd, while saying he welcomed the inquiry and its recommendations, said he didn't agree with this finding that he and Cooper ignored the warnings from the municipal lawyer.  Cooper said Monday evening she was still digesting the report and did not yet have any comment. Houghton did not immediately reply to a phone or text message.  In the end, the bidding process was ""blighted by unfair advantage,"" the inquiry found. The successful bidder, PowerStream, had insider information all along, had written the news release announcing the bidding process itself and then won despite offering $3.85 million less than the highest bidder, Hydro One, the report said. The judge's recommendations include: Ontario's Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing said in a statement Monday evening that the Municipal Conflict of Interest Act has ""been effective in ensuring transparency and accountability across Ontario's 444 municipalities"" but that the government will take a look at Marrocco's recommendations ""for future consideration."" Collingwood's current mayor, Brian Saunderson, said Monday that he's ""very excited"" to get the report and that it validates the concerns the town had when it asked for the public inquiry — the final tab for which will exceed $7 million. ""At the end of the day, it's dispelling some clouds that have been hovering over our community since these transactions happened,"" he said. He said that he disagreed that the town had gotten good value on the contracts for the pool and the new arena. An OPP investigation into the arena and pool construction deal, which began in 2013, is ongoing, the force said on Monday. No criminal charges have been laid. "
4,"3 dead, 1 injured after shooting in rural Vancouver Island community","Mon, 2 Nov 2020 12:55:16 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/3-dead-vancouver-island-1.5786357?cmp=rss,CBC News,"Police are investigating after the discovery Sunday of three bodies and another person who was injured in a popular off-roading area near a rural Vancouver Island community. RCMP said a man was riding a motorcycle on Melrose Forest Service Road in Qualicum Beach, B.C., shortly after 2 p.m. PT Sunday, when he came across a man who was unresponsive. Qualicum Beach is about 160 kilometres northwest of Victoria.  The motorcyclist immediately called police and other first responders. Paramedics and police found the man and confirmed he was dead. They found a burnt-out travel trailer nearby with two people dead inside. They also discovered a man in another trailer who appeared to have been shot. WATCH | Aerial view of crime scene: B.C. Emergency Health Services said the injured man was taken to the Qualicum Beach airport, where he was airlifted to hospital in critical condition. Police said the man is now stable. ""Initial findings lead investigators to believe that this is an isolated incident between parties well known to one another,"" Cpl. Jesse Forman with the RCMP said in a written statement. ""We do not believe there is any ongoing risk to the public."" Residents said the area where the bodies were found is a popular spot for off-roading recreation. Mike Johnson was on his way to do some off-road 4x4 driving when he found the area blocked off with a cluster of media in attendance. Johnson, who lives in nearby Errington, said it's a quiet area that sometimes gets summer campers and has few problems other than some illegal trash dumping, or the occasional person passed out in the bush from too much to drink. ""This whole area is like a giant off-road park,"" he said. ""This kind of thing just doesn't happen out here."" High-school student Cooper Selva said he had just returned from dirt-biking in the area when he learned the bodies had been discovered near where he rides with his friends.  ""They're probably dirt bike riders, too, and it scares me,"" Selva said. ""It makes me just want to stay home and not be active and go outside."" The Vancouver Island Integrated Major Crime Unit has taken over the investigation. The B.C. Coroners Service said it is investigating the deaths in the Whiskey Creek area, about 10 minutes southwest of Qualicum Beach. The coroner did not provide more details, including where the people died or any of their identities. RCMP are asking anyone with dashcam footage or trail-camera video from the area to call call its tip line at 250-380-6211. "
5,"Trailer hitch assault on First Nations woman in Thunder Bay not only factor in her death, defence argues","Mon, 2 Nov 2020 19:14:40 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/trailer-hitch-manslaughter-trial-1.5786943?cmp=rss,Jody Porter,"The man accused of killing a First Nations woman by throwing a trailer hitch at her from a passing car told his friends that night that he ""wanted to drive around and yell at hookers,"" according to testimony entered into evidence at his trial in Thunder Bay, Ont. on Monday. Brayden Bushby, 21, pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and not guilty to manslaughter in Ontario Superior Court, relocated to a hotel ballroom after a fire at the Thunder Bay courthouse. He had been charged with second-degree murder after Barbara Kentner, 34, died in July 2017. She'd suffered a perforated bowel after being struck by a trailer hitch thrown at her from a passing car six months earlier. ""All [Bushby] was doing was laughing,"" after throwing the hitch, witness Nathan Antoniszyn told the court during a preliminary hearing in September 2018. The publication ban on his testimony was lifted on Monday when the transcript was entered as evidence in the trial. Antoniszyn said Bushby was clearly drunk as they and two other people were driving around after midnight on Jan. 29, 2017. Bushby was sitting on the window sill of the front passenger seat after picking up the hitch from the roadside earlier in the night, he said. ""And I hear a big bang and I look back and I see there's two people behind us,"" Antoniszyn said. ""There's one of them on the ground and one of them standing up."" Court also heard videotaped evidence from Kentner, in a sworn statement she gave police in March 2017. The trailer hitch ""hit me right across the stomach, I couldn't breathe,"" she said. ""I was crying and crawling along. I just wanted to lay there,"" she said. Kentner recalled the person who threw the hitch from the passing car yelling, ""Yeah, I got one."" Her sister, Melissa Kentner, who was with Barbara that night, said she also heard that phrase. She was the first witness at the trial, and told the court she was walking ahead of her sister, telling her to hurry up because it was cold when a car started driving toward them. ""And that kid was hanging out the window,"" she told the court eyeing Bushby from the witness stand. ""I hear a clink, clink sound and I hear that kid say 'Oh, I got one.'"" The family had hoped the case would be prosecuted as a hate crime and hundreds of First Nations leaders from across the country expressed outrage when the charge against Bushby was changed from second-degree murder to manslaughter. But Bushby's lawyer told the court in his opening statement that it was not a racially motivated crime ""despite media attempts to characterize this offence as such."" Instead, lawyer George Joseph said it was ""just people being stupid."" Joseph also told the court that he was setting out to prove that something else happened to Kentner which would show that what Bushby did was no longer a ""significant contributing cause"" of her death. During cross-examination, Joseph noted Kenter was on parole and, as a condition, had a curfew. Kentner said she had her parole officer's permission to ignore the curfew. Joseph claimed that the ""real reason"" that Melissa waited until the morning after Barbara had been struck by the trailer hitch before going to the hospital was to avoid arrest on breach of her conditions. ""This isn't about me, this is about my sister,"" Kentner shot back. ""For my sister's health, I would have done it."" Assitant Crown Attorney Andrew Sadler said problems in convening a jury were a factor in how Bushby came to be tried by a judge alone on the lesser charge of manslaughter. The second-degree murder trial, initially scheduled for January was pushed back to April while lawyers awaited clarity on new rules for jury selection, Sadler told CBC News in an interview. ""Everyone was of the view that this wasn't a case that, because of a procedural or technical issue, we wanted to risk having to run the trial and then having to run it again knowing we got the procedure wrong,"" he said. That delay pushed the trial date to April and then came the disruptions caused by COVID-19 and the difficulties it presented in convening a jury trial.  In September, Bushby agreed to plead guilty to aggravated assault and changed his selection to judge alone, paving the way for the trial to proceed in October, Sadler said. But then, a fire damaged the courthouse and the trial was delayed again. It was only on Sunday that court staff confirmed the trial would proceed, in the ballroom of the Courthouse Hotel, a building that was an actual courthouse until 2016.  ""I appreciate that the hotel made this space available so this trial could proceed,"" said Justice Helen Pierce in her opening remarks, noting that there may be ""glitches"" because of the change in venue. ""It is my goal to treat each person in this courtroom respectfully, in turn I ask each of you to treat each other respectfully so the court can proceed peacefully,"" she said. The Crown said it will call a forensic pathologist as its next witness when the trial resumes at 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday. "
6,This man died in RCMP custody while a report that might have saved his life sat on a desk,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 04:00:00 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/rcmp-stroke-death-custody-1.5778961?cmp=rss,Rosa Marchitelli,"The sisters of a man who died in RCMP custody say they want to remember their younger brother as a gentle guy who loved to joke around; not lying on the cold floor of an RCMP drunk tank, even though he had no drugs or alcohol in his system.  They say his life might have been saved if Mounties had acted on recommendations made in the aftermath of a similar case — at the same detachment in Airdrie, Alta. — years before.  Instead, those recommendations have languished on the desk of RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki for two years, kept from public view, while loved ones struggle to get answers about Michael Mullock's death. Officers picked up Mullock outside a mall for public intoxication on May 24, 2019. Hours later, when he started vomiting in the cell, paramedics were called in to assess him. But instead of taking the 50-year-old man to hospital, they decided he was ""fit for incarceration"" and left him there. Mullock died a few hours later. ""He died alone on the cement floor like that. That's pretty hard to swallow,"" Mullock's sister, Carla Asselin, told Go Public. The RCMP says guards checked on Mullock every 15 minutes while he was in custody, per policy, until he was found ""unresponsive.""  He had been arrested near a car, but the RCMP says a breathalyzer test wasn't done because the car was parked and Mullock was standing outside. Officers say they saw empty medication and alcohol bottles inside. But the coroner's report found no alcohol or drugs in Mullock's system. Instead, it found he died of a stroke. ""Something just does not sit right with this whole situation,"" Asselin said.  Mullock's other sister, Dawn Gallant, says the paramedics should also ""have to take some responsibility for this."" ""I think the protocol should be changed, if someone is vomiting while they're in that situation, just take them to the hospital,"" she said.  The RCMP says, across the country, a total of 11,325 complaints have been filed against it over the last five years. But it says it doesn't track how many of those involved in-custody deaths or serious injury. Instead, it gave Go Public numbers on complaints that range from ""neglect of duty"" to ""improper arrest."" Federal policing expert Darryl Davies says there is no incentive for the national police force to take responsibility or change the way it operates when things go wrong — because the system set up to hold police accountable is ""pathetic."" ""The RCMP like the system the way it is. It works for them, not for the victims,"" said Davies. This has happened before, four years earlier.  In February, Go Public reported on how another man, Alan Ruel, was arrested for public intoxication in July 2015, even though he wasn't drunk. RCMP surveillance cameras recorded the entire 18 hours Ruel was in custody, and how he went from being able to stand and walk around, to lying on the floor twitching and half paralyzed. Gallant had no idea history had repeated itself until almost a year after her brother died, when she saw the Go Public story and the video of Ruel. ""When I saw Alan Ruel in that cell, I just pictured my brother there alone,"" she said. Gallant said she was ""floored"" by how similar the cases are. She tried to get the RCMP to hand over the surveillance video of her brother, but was told it couldn't due to the Privacy Act.  The sisters say investigators have kept the family in the dark — despite their repeated attempts to get answers. WATCH | Disturbing video of Alan Ruel in the RCMP lockup: Go Public asked the Alberta RCMP for a copy of its internal investigation into Mullock's death, which found no one was at fault, but spokesperson Fraser Logan said, generally, findings are only made public when ""criminal charges are being laid."" The RCMP says paramedics were interviewed as part of its investigation, but only to confirm dates, timings and duration of their calls to the detachment the day Mullock died. Alberta Health Services wouldn't answer Go Public's questions about why the paramedics left Mullock in the cell instead of taking him to hospital, also citing privacy rules. A nagging question for the family is — could all this have been avoided? After Ruel's stroke but before Mullock's, the RCMP's civilian watchdog made recommendations to the force that could have changed how such situations are handled.  But after more than two years, the RCMP commissioner has yet to respond. Until she does, the report remains confidential. An RCMP spokesperson in Ottawa told Go Public the ""response has been prioritized,"" and that the commissioner will provide ""a thorough and well-founded response … as soon as feasible."" The RCMP is also locked in a civil suit with Ruel. His mind is still unclear after his ordeal, and he has limited mobility on the left side of his body.  ""They [the RCMP] should have learned from my case,"" Ruel said. The RCMP says his lawsuit has nothing to do with its delay responding to the report from the Civilian Review and Complaints Commission (CRCC) and that the two are ""separate and distinct processes.""  According to the CRCC there are 149 reports about complaints against the RCMP that are waiting for a response from the force. One report has remained unanswered for three and a half years. The commission and the RCMP agreed in December that the force would respond to the reports within six months. But since then, the RCMP has missed the deadline 19 times. The problem, says Davies, a professor with the sociology department at Carleton University in Ottawa, is that there is no legal requirement to respond to complaints by a certain deadline. Instead, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act says it needs to respond as ""soon as feasible."" They also don't have to accept the CRCC's findings, nor its recommendations. ""They have absolutely no impact on the RCMP. They change nothing unless the RCMP agrees with them. Those recommendations should be mandatory by law."" However, according to the RCMP, over the past year, the commissioner has accepted about 76 per cent of the CRCC's recommendations and 85 per cent of its findings against the force.  The federal government is talking about taking action, but hasn't offered a timeline or commitment. ""I am prepared, if it's necessary, to make legislative and regulatory changes to ensure that that happens,"" Public Safety Minister Bill Blair told Go Public. ""Families should not have to wait for very long periods of time, even as long as years to the resolution of the complaints process. So we'll make sure that the rules are in place."" As for the two families who share a very similar story, both continue to wait for answers. Ruel's lawsuit is now into its third year. In court documents, the RCMP deny there were ""obvious signs"" he was in medical distress.  Asselin and Gallant say they'll continue to press the RCMP for answers. ""That's just not fair to the people that are waiting for these answers. It's almost like torture, we just want to understand what happened to our loved one,"" Asselin said. ""I understand that their [RCMP's] job is not easy, but people are reaching out and giving them ideas and suggestions that could help… listen to them. That's the frustrating part.""

8,"RCMP looking to update de-escalation training, will introduce new anti-racism program: Lucki","Mon, 2 Nov 2020 12:10:40 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/public-safety-committee-blair-1.5776921?cmp=rss,Catharine Tunney,"RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki says the force is looking to update its de-escalation training and will soon introduce new mandatory anti-racism training — measures that came in the wake of mounting scrutiny of the national police force's actions in recent months. ""I've been listening. I've been learning,"" Lucki, who has come under criticism for struggling to address systemic racism in the force, told the standing committee on public safety and national security during an appearance Monday evening. ""We're looking at our organization as a whole, and we're looking at those systems and those processes, those policies and procedures that will eliminate systemic racism."" Lucki said the RCMP has helped set up two task forces: one looking at police intervention tactics and another at mental health calls.  The RCMP — which provides contract policing in all three territories and most provinces — has been under added pressure to explain how it responds to mental health crises since an officer shot and killed Rodney Levi, a member of the Metepenagiag First Nation in New Brunswick, in early June. His death is now under review by an outside police watchdog agency.  The number of interactions between the Mounties and people experiencing mental health crises is steadily increasing in most provinces and territories, according to newly released figures. Last year, out of the more than three million calls received, more than 123,000 were ""mental health occurrences"" — the force's term for a police interaction with someone suffering from a mental health crisis — the RCMP reported. That marks a slight increase over 2018, when the RCMP recorded about 118,323 mental health calls and just under three million calls. The RCMP's use of force became a topic of national debate after two high-profile interactions were caught on camera this summer.  In one, an officer in Nunavut was seen slamming the door of his vehicle into an intoxicated man — a move even Lucki has called into question. In the other, a video showed RCMP officers punching Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam and putting him in a hold outside of a casino after Adam was stopped for driving with expired plates. The officers involved said the chief was resisting arrest.  All RCMP cadets are trained on an incident management intervention model, which is meant to help them assess when to use verbal de-escalation or force during a situation. ""One of the things that we've been looking at is obviously updating our de-escalation and crisis intervention training and re-certifying that training annually,"" Lucki told the committee. ""I've been leading a discussion with the police chiefs across the country on our intervention model."" According to recently published RCMP numbers, while there has been a decrease in the number of ""hard techniques,"" which includes takedowns, punches, kicks and the carotid control technique, there has been an increase in the number of officer-involved shooting occurrences over the last decade. In 2010, there were six non-fatal shootings, while in 2019 there were 24 non-fatal shootings, the RCMP's own statistics showed. There has also been a slight increase in fatal shootings with six in 2010 and nine last year. She said the force is also looking at making anti-racism training mandatory, although what it would look like is still being developed. ""It will be slightly delayed because we are going to co-develop that anti-racism training with the people that are most impacted by that and getting a lot of input to create that training,"" she said, ""But in the meantime, we have rolled out cultural and humility training, and all senior managers have taken it. It's rolled out to all employees, and it will be mandatory for each and every employee."" In an attempt to root out racism, the head Mountie said her team is also looking at tweaking the recruitment process. ""We're looking at the way in which we recruit. We want to make sure that we are, in fact, reflective of the communities that we serve,"" she said. ""We are going to be testing for those types of behaviours that could negatively impact their interactions."" The commissioner's comments come after Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde called on her to resign after she defended the RCMP's response to the ongoing dispute between Mi'kmaw lobster harvesters and non-Indigenous commercial fishers in Nova Scotia. Under his own round of questioning, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair spoke about the importance of ridding police ranks of racists.  ""There's absolutely no place in policing, in law enforcement or in any element of public service for racists and white supremacists and anti-Semites and Islamophobia, and I think that we have a responsibility to purge those influences and those individuals from the public service and most certainly from policing,"" he said while answering a question from Green MP Elizabeth May if he would take a systematic look at white supremacy within federal policing. ""I will tell you that I believe that the overwhelming majority of police officers do their job with integrity and professionalism and a very sincere respect for all of the people in Canada. But but we also know that ideologically motivated extremism, white supremacy is unfortunately tragically pervasive in certain elements of our society."" "
9,"Quebec's religious symbols ban dashed dreams and sparked hate, witnesses testify on 1st day of Bill 21 trial","Mon, 2 Nov 2020 04:00:00 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/bill-21-challenge-in-court-1.5784253?cmp=rss,Jonathan Montpetit,"A test of the constitutionality of Quebec's secularism law began Monday amid tearful testimony from Muslim and Sikh teachers who said the law derailed their careers and made them targets of bigotry. The law, which was passed last year despite protests from civil rights groups and religious minorities, is facing four different lawsuits that claim it violates the Constitution in a number of different ways. All the lawsuits take issue with provisions in the law that prohibit public teachers, as well as government lawyers and other civil servants, from wearing religious symbols at work. On the first day of the trial, the plaintiffs called witnesses in an effort to demonstrate the law has upended the personal and professional lives of religious minorities in the province.  Messaouda Dridj, an elementary school teacher in Montreal, said it was a childhood dreams of hers to immigrate to Quebec from her native Algeria. She arrived in 2004, drawn by the province's francophone culture and tolerant society. When Dridj, who wears a hijab, was unable to find work as an electrical engineer, she became a teacher. But under the grandfather clause in the law, she can no longer be promoted, switch positions or teach at a different school, unless she removes her hijab.  That, she told the court, would mean losing part of her identity. ""I wouldn't be able to look at myself in the mirror,"" she said. Dridj broke into tears as she expressed her frustration at being unable to pursue different career opportunities, unlike her colleagues who don't wear religious symbols. She said the spirit of tolerance that she first experienced in Quebec disappeared during the acrimonious public debate that accompanied the passage of secularism law, widely known in English as Bill 21. ""People would honk at me and say 'go home,'"" she said. Ichrak Nourel Hak, who launched a legal challenge against Bill 21 hours after it was passed, said it ended her dream of teaching in a public school, forcing her to look for work in the private system instead. ""I feel excluded from Quebec society,"" said Hak, who also wears the hijab. ""I am a Muslim woman, but I am also a Quebec citizen."" Amrit Kaur, a Sikh woman from Montreal who wears a turban (dastar), told the court she was forced to take a teaching job in British Columbia after she finished her education degree in 2019. ""My faith plays no role in the classroom. I am expected to teach what's in the curriculum,"" she said. As a former spokesperson for the World Sikh Organization, Kaur was a public opponent of Bill 21, which made her a target of abuse on social media. ""Quebec is an inhospitable environment,"" she said. WATCH | Muslim rights group calls Bill 21 'shameful': Illustrating the harms of Bill 21 forms only one part of the case against the Quebec government.  The more difficult task for the plaintiffs will be convincing Quebec Superior Court Justice Marc André Blanchard that these harms are relevant, from a legal point of view. Quebec has invoked the notwithstanding clause, which prevents the plaintiffs from appealing to the sections of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms that protect freedom of religion and prohibit discrimination based on gender or race. That has forced the plaintiffs to build their case on less tested jurisprudence. Their arguments include the claim that the law violates the Quebec Act of 1774, transgresses ""unwritten principles"" of the Constitution and is the equivalent of criminal legislation. Lawyers for the government did not speak with reporters and were circumspect in the courtroom on Monday, asking few questions when cross-examining the witnesses. But in documents already filed with the court, it appears Quebec will argue the province's legislature should be able to arrange state-religion relations as it sees fit, without interference from the courts. It will claim, too, that Bill 21 amounts to a moderate response to long-running unease in Quebec about the place of religion in the public sphere. With such important questions at stake in the trial, many legal observers are already expecting it will eventually end up before the Supreme Court. Outside the courtroom, both literally and figuratively, Bill 21 faces renewed opposition from civil society groups who have targeted the law as part of a broader struggle against systemic racism. On Monday morning, before the trial began, dozens of law students from McGill University joined anti-racism activists on the steps of Superior Court building in Montreal for a brief demonstration. They called Bill 21 ""racist,"" saying it disproportionately affects people of colour, creates ""second-class citizens"" and is ""legalized discrimination."" ""For us, a law that discriminates on the basis of religious symbols has no place in 2020. It is something that will encourage systemic racism and inflame Islamophobia in Quebec,"" said Fanny Caire, a law student at McGill University.  The trial continues Tuesday morning, and is likely to run at least four weeks.

10,Biden's path to victory gives him more margin for error than Trump's — and Hillary Clinton's,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 04:00:00 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/grenier-us-election-polls-1.5785599?cmp=rss,Éric Grenier,"If this was any other election, there would be little doubt that Joe Biden will become the president-elect after the votes in Tuesday's U.S. presidential election are counted. But after 2016's surprise victory by Donald Trump, more than 230,000 deaths in the United States caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the possibility that the results could wind up before the courts, this is not any other election. Nevertheless, Biden remains the favourite to win — and his chances look better than Hillary Clinton's did four years ago. According to Sunday's update of the CBC News Presidential Poll Tracker (check the interactive for the latest updated estimates between now and Tuesday), Biden holds an eight-point lead over Trump among decided voters nationwide. That lead has held relatively steady ever since Biden officially became the Democratic nominee for president in mid-August, with the margin holding at between seven and 11 points over that time. There has been little evidence that the race has significantly tightened, beyond the slow reduction of Biden's bump coming out of the first presidential debate at the end of September. WATCH | What a Biden presidency could mean for Canada: National support does not decide U.S. elections, however. Twice in the last five elections, the winner of the popular vote — Al Gore in 2000 and Clinton in 2016 — did not win the presidency. That's because elections are decided by the electoral college, which awards the winner of each individual state (with the exception of Nebraska and Maine) a number of votes equal to the state's representation in Congress. Biden's advantage in the electoral college is not as wide as his lead in national polling, but it is still robust. He is ahead by at least five percentage points in enough states to get him more than the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the election. He is ahead by smaller margins in enough additional states to turn the result into a rout. This includes solid leads in the Rust Belt states of Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan that were carried by Trump in 2016 by narrow margins. Biden has a smaller edge in Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Ohio and North Carolina — states Trump also won four years ago. In 2016, Clinton was widely viewed as the heavy favourite to win. But just because she didn't pull it off in that election doesn't mean that Biden's good numbers should be seen as equally illusory. Biden's lead over Trump is much wider than Clinton's at this point of the 2016 campaign. His lead is about twice as wide in national polling, and he is ahead in states worth 368 electoral college votes. Clinton was ahead in states worth only 323 electoral college votes, giving her less margin for error. In fact, the former vice-president's lead is wide enough to withstand a polling error similar to the one that happened in 2016. Only in North Carolina, Georgia and Ohio would the same error cost Biden his lead. That would not be enough to give Trump the win — he'd need a bigger swing in his favour in Pennsylvania, Florida and one of Arizona, Minnesota or Wisconsin. And that's assuming he holds Texas, where the Democrats actually out-performed expectations in 2016. This is because Biden has a wider lead than Clinton had in nearly every state. The only states in which Trump is doing better than he did four years ago are bedrock Republican states. But there's good reason to doubt that the same kind of error as in 2016 is likely this time. Pollsters have changed their methodologies to account for the Trump supporters missed in the polls last time. Biden is much more popular than Clinton was in 2016, making fewer voters choose between two unpalatable options. And there are far fewer Americans who are undecided or say they will vote for a third-party candidate — about five per cent compared with nearly 13 per cent at this point in 2016. The path that takes Biden to the White House is a simple one: He wins the states in which the polls show him as the favourite, largely recreating (and potentially expanding upon) Barack Obama's winning maps in 2008 and 2012. If the results do not go entirely as the polls predict, however, Biden still has some options. He could win the states in the Rust Belt that have traditionally supported the Democrats by winning back the support of whites, particularly Catholics or those without a college degree. With Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan going Democratic blue again, Biden doesn't need to win the swing states in the south and southwest. Adding Ohio and Iowa to his column would make his margin safer. If, however, he is not able to win back the Midwest, he can look to an expanded map in the Sun Belt, carrying Florida and any one of Arizona, Georgia or North Carolina with the help of high turnout among Black and Hispanic voters. If he doesn't win Florida, he could swap in all three of those other states instead. Flipping Texas, where he trails, and its 38 electoral college votes would make things even easier for him. In either of these scenarios, Biden ends up with just over 270 electoral college votes. But a combination of them, with perhaps a state or two staying Republican, would give him a solid mandate that could be invulnerable to potential court challenges. Trump's path to victory requires things to go just right for him — and in a much bigger way than they did four years ago. His win in 2016 was razor-thin. He lost the popular vote by two percentage points and carried Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by less than a point. The error in the polls was just enough to turn a Clinton win into a Trump squeaker. He needs the same thing to happen again. He needs to come out on top in the close races in Ohio and Georgia — states he won by comfortable margins in 2016 — and overturn the two- or three-point deficit he has in Florida and North Carolina. He's trailed in Arizona for most of the race, but he needs to hold it. Then it comes down to Pennsylvania, where he is behind by about 5.5 points. He trailed Clinton by four points there in 2016, and it will take a bigger lift to win it this time. If he doesn't, he then needs to look to states like Michigan, Wisconsin or Minnesota, where Biden is ahead by between eight or nine points. It's not impossible or even implausible. But the factors that worked to Trump's favour in 2016 — pollster error, lots of undecideds and an unpopular opponent — are unlikely to be as beneficial to him in 2020. He'll need all of these factors to not only happen again, but to be masking his potential vote by an even greater degree than before. That is if every vote counts. The president has spent the last few months disputing that this election would be fair, claiming rampant fraud without proof. He has questioned whether the counting should continue after Tuesday, when a large number of (likely Democratic-leaning) early and absentee ballots will be counted. There's no ruling out that this election won't end up before the courts, leaving the outcome to a few judges. But first things first — election day. And if this were a normal election, Biden's odds would look very good. We'll find out soon just how abnormal this election will turn out to be. What do you want to know about the U.S. election?

11,"Canada-U.S. relations could worsen in a second Trump term, says ex-ambassador John Bolton","Mon, 2 Nov 2020 16:00:00 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trump-dim-view-canada-john-bolton-1.5786443?cmp=rss,John Paul Tasker,"U.S. President Donald Trump does not think highly of Canada, says his former national security adviser John Bolton — who warns that the bilateral relationship could deteriorate even further in a second Trump term. Bolton, who served as Trump's national security advisor in 2018-19, told CBC News that Trump thinks Canada has ""out-negotiated"" past U.S. administrations on trade and defence matters for decades. He said the former real estate promoter takes a ""transactional"" approach to foreign relations, with no policy or ideology underpinning his strategy beyond a fixation on the ""dollars and cents."" When trade issues aren't top of mind, Bolton said, Trump thinks little of Canada because it doesn't advance his electoral agenda. ""The president does not have a philosophy. He is not a conservative. He doesn't pursue a grand strategy. He doesn't think about what we conventionally mean when we use the word 'policy,'"" Bolton said in an interview with Vassy Kapelos on CBC's Power & Politics. ""When trade matters are not roiling the waters between the U.S. and Canada, he tends to think about himself, which is his default position."" The interview with Bolton aired on CBC News Network at 5 p.m. ET today. Bolton, a hawkish conservative who served as former president George W. Bush's ambassador to the UN in 2005-06, has been critical of Trump since leaving the administration. Bolton's book, The Room Where It Happened, paints Trump as an unsavoury and ""stunningly uninformed"" character who understands little about statecraft. He describes the Trump White House as a chaotic, rudderless place where decisions are made in a scattershot fashion. Trump has said Bolton's book is ""a compilation of lies and made up stories, all intended to make me look bad."" Bolton has said he will not vote for Trump or for his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden. If Trump doesn't willingly leave the White House after a clear defeat, Bolton said, prominent Republicans will face a ""character test."" ""I expect that the leaders of the party certainly are going to stand up, as they did when it came time for Richard Nixon to resign, and say it's time to leave,"" he said, referring to the former U.S. president who resigned the presidency after the Watergate affair. ""It will be up to us to say we simply don't accept this behaviour."" WATCH: John Bolton says Republicans face a ""character test."" Canada has been in Trump's crosshairs since the day he announced he was a candidate for the presidency in 2015. Trump spent much of the primaries and presidential campaign slamming the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) as a bad deal for the U.S. that resulted in job losses and hardship in the country's industrial Midwest. In renegotiating the trilateral trade deal, he forced Canada to make concessions on agriculture by opening up the supply-managed market to more U.S. imports of dairy products and other goods. During a campaign sweep through North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin today, Trump criticized Joe Biden for supporting NAFTA, saying the deal was terrible and Canada is difficult to deal with on the trade file.  ""He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, which was the worst trade deal ever made probably by any country,"" Trump said. ""I'll tell you, Mexico, we've had a great relationship with Mexico. Canada is a little difficult to deal with, to be honest with you. You know, O Canada. We all love O Canada, right. I love that. They stand for their national anthem and we have to stand too.""  The Trump administration has also hit Canada with tariffs on key exports such as steel, which it has justified by claiming the imports threaten the continued functioning of U.S. companies that supply the American military — a largely baseless claim. The U.S. pulled the tariffs but the U.S. Trade Representative, Robert Lighthizer, has said that decision will be reviewed after Tuesday's election. Trump also has taken aim at Canada and other NATO allies for failing to meet spending targets that call on each member country to contribute 2 per cent of their gross domestic product (GDP) to the military — a spending threshold Canada hasn't met in decades. Trump has, in turn, painted allies as freeloaders that exploit American generosity. Bolton said Trump's view of Canada, long seen as the U.S.'s closest ally, likely wouldn't change in a second term. In fact, Bolton said, Trump likely would be even more aggressive on foreign policy after re-election because he'd be largely free from electoral considerations. ""Trump did not make decisions on the basis of weighing the pros and cons of the options available to him, or by doing cost-benefit analysis. He decides on an ad-hoc basis, often based on what he believed the political ramifications would be in the United States,"" Bolton said. ""If he wins re-election, he passes by a guardrail that in his first term was a major constraint. And in a second term, I think it makes him much more unpredictable. I think it's harder to judge what he would do in a second term than any president in recent American experience."" Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the federal Liberal government are preparing for all eventualities. Last week, Trudeau convened a meeting with Canada's ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, and Canadian consul generals. ""We will, of course, be watching election day unfold in the United States with confidence in American democracy and their democratic traditions that have managed this event every four years for a very, very long time successfully,"" Trudeau said during a news conference on Thursday. ""There have been situations — in 2000, for example — where it was a matter of weeks before arriving at a final outcome. And as we did then, we will follow along carefully without interfering or intervening in well-established processes internal to the United States's democracy."" Speaking to CBC over the weekend, Hillman said she has no concerns about disruptions to Canada's economy should the results of the U.S. presidential election be delayed or contested. Bolton said that while he's not supporting Biden, he thinks he'll likely be the winner after all the votes are tallied — but he said Trump still has an outside chance. He said pollsters have been consistently wrong when measuring Trump's appeal among white working class voters, and those people could show up for Trump in droves for in-person voting on Tuesday. ""The entire country is still operating under the mistakes that the pollsters and the commentators made in 2016,"" Bolton said. ""So my view is, right now, I would bet a dollar, a U.S. dollar, that Biden wins, but I wouldn't bet any more than that."" Bolton said he's hoping for a peaceful transition of power if Trump loses — but he warns that, with Trump, anything is possible. ""He cares about himself. He doesn't care about our institutions. And I don't expect his departure to be gracious, although I don't think we're going to have to pry his fingernails away from the Resolute desk,"" he said. "
12,The latest on the coronavirus outbreak for Nov. 2,"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:32:19 EDT",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/coronavirus-newsletter-nov-2-1.5786888?cmp=rss,,"Manitoba mulling curfew to stem tide of COVID-19 cases Manitoba Premier Brian Pallister is vowing to ramp up COVID-19 enforcement, and says his government is giving ""serious consideration"" to imposing a curfew to stop people from gathering in large groups. He said the province's chief public health officer has recommended steps to curb such gatherings. ""These late-night situations in Winnipeg have expanded our number of COVID cases significantly,"" Pallister said Monday morning. ""According to Dr. [Brent] Roussin, this is an action that we should seriously consider, and I am seriously considering it now."" Pallister made the announcement at a news conference on the first day Winnipeg and the surrounding area were placed under heightened pandemic restrictions. The region moved into the red, or critical, stage of the provincial pandemic response plan as of Monday. Movie theatres, libraries, sports facilities, restaurants, bars and dining rooms are closed for at least two weeks. Hospital visits have been suspended, and fitness facilities and retail outlets have been reduced to 25 per cent capacity. The premier urged Manitobans on Monday to restrict the number of personal contacts they have by 75 per cent for the month of November. Winnipeg is in the midst of a COVID-19 surge that has raised dire concerns from experts about Manitoba's health-care capacity. A series of incremental restrictions rolled out slightly more than a month ago did little to stem the spread. ""When we were abiding by the fundamentals, we were beating COVID. And some of us lost our way, and now COVID is beating us,"" Pallister said. ""Perhaps we were cursed by our early success.... All of us have to get back to the fundamentals."" Health officials announced 241 new cases Monday, as well as five deaths. The provincial totals since the pandemic began stand at 6,275 cases and 80 deaths. IN BRIEF Why Ontario hospitals are full to bursting, despite few COVID-19 patients Some of Ontario's largest hospitals are nearing or exceeding full capacity even before flu season and the second wave of COVID-19 bring an expected surge in new patients. Data obtained by CBC News shows that the acute care wards of a dozen major hospitals were filled above 95 per cent of their funded capacity for more than half the days in September and early October. Those rates significantly exceed the province's maximum occupancy target of 85 per cent. That was set earlier this year for hospitals to get the green light to resume scheduled surgeries, such as organ transplants, cancer operations and cardiac surgeries, which were basically halted during the pandemic's first wave. Many of the hospitals running at or over capacity are in Ottawa and the Greater Toronto Area, the regions hit hardest by COVID-19 cases this fall. However, some hospitals outside those regions are also full to bursting, including in Sudbury, Hamilton, the Niagara region and Peterborough. The data suggests many hospitals have returned to the overcrowding levels seen before the pandemic, when CBC News revealed hospitals filled beyond capacity nearly every single day, with patients housed in hallways, conference rooms and cafeterias not as exceptional cases, but as a matter of routine. Most of Ontario's large community hospitals are effectively full, said Anthony Dale, CEO of the Ontario Hospital Association. ""Hospitals are walking across a tightrope right now,"" said Dale in an interview. ""We're back to where we were pre-COVID with the risk of hallway health care. And you can't have hallway health care in a pandemic because of the need for infection prevention and control."" Hospital occupancy levels typically peak in winter, a key reason behind the province's push to keep the number of COVID-19 cases down this fall. Rexall pharmacies temporarily pause flu shot program because of supply issues  A major pharmacy chain has temporarily paused its flu shot program in Ontario because of what it describes as ongoing supply issues. A spokesperson from Rexall says that the company is making ""all efforts"" to secure more doses promptly. Vaccine supply is determined and allocated by the Ministry of Health. At a news conference Monday, Ontario Premier Doug Ford took aim at the company, saying: ""Don't overbook people.... You knew exactly how many flu shots you had, so don't overbook."" When asked about the issue, Ontario's minister of health said the province was currently having its most successful flu-shot campaign ever. Christine Elliott said during question period that more than one million flu shots have been administered this year compared to approximately 150,000 at the same time last year. The government has been encouraging residents to get their flu shot this year, saying that doing so would help preserve hospital capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic. U.K. PM defends lockdown amid criticism of delay British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday defended his decision to impose a second national lockdown 40 days after scientific advisers recommended such a move amid criticism that weeks of delay have meant thousands more infections and hundreds of needless deaths. The comments came as Johnson gave the House of Commons details of the proposed four-week lockdown in England that is set to begin Thursday. The plan was hurriedly announced Saturday after updated projections showed that rapidly rising infection rates risked swamping hospitals in a matter of weeks. ""Faced with these latest figures, there is no alternative but to take further action at a national level,"" Johnson told lawmakers, adding it was right to try imposing local measures first. ""I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level with strong local action and strong local leadership."" The new policy comes three weeks after Johnson announced plans for a three-tiered regional approach to combating the virus, with tighter restrictions imposed on areas with higher infection rates. The government chose that strategy in an effort to reduce the economic and social impact of new restrictions, even though a committee of scientific advisers on Sept. 21 recommended a short lockdown as a ""circuit breaker"" to slow the spread of COVID-19. But that approach became untenable after new analysis showed COVID-19 was spreading so rapidly that the number of deaths this winter could more than double those recorded earlier this year.

Your mask questions answered We're answering your questions about the pandemic. Send yours to COVID@cbc.ca, and we'll answer as many as we can. We publish a selection of answers online and also put some questions to the experts during The National and on CBC News Network. So far, we've received more than 55,000 emails from all corners of the country. Most of us are wearing masks a lot, and winter is approaching. That's led CBC readers to send us new, more detailed and more seasonal questions about wearing masks to protect against the spread of COVID-19. We checked in with experts for the answers. If we're wearing masks, do we still have to distance? Yes, distancing is still required, as regular medical and non-medical masks only reduce the number of particles from your nose and mouth. They don't eliminate them, says Dr. Anand Kumar, associate professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. (Respirator masks such as N95s do a much better job of filtering particles.) While most masks reduce particle spread by about 80 per cent, ""that leaves 20 per cent of particles still going out. How far? Nobody really knows,"" Kumar told CBC News. But the greater the distance, the greater the protection, whether you're wearing a mask or not. Doubling the distance between you and another person reduces the viral particles reaching you about eightfold, Kumar said. And wearing a mask should cause the larger, most-infectious particles to drop close to an infected mask wearer before they can reach another person. So, how close can you get if you're both wearing masks? There's no definite answer, says Martin Fischer, an associate professor of chemistry at Duke University in Durham, N.C., who has studied how to measure the effectiveness of different masks. That's because the risks depend on so many factors, such as how well the masks worn by each person stop particles and how long you interact. Kumar and other experts note that approaches such as masking and distancing should be thought of as ""layers"" of protection that are ""worn"" together and aren't replacements for one another. ""It's not one or the other.... It's as many as you can do that gives you maximum protection."" Read more questions and answers about masks here. AND FINALLY... Take a walk on the woolly side with llamas and alpacas to ease pandemic stress  Here's a novel way to combat the anxiety of COVID-19: Why not take a llama for a stroll and feel the stress melt away as you amble along with your borrowed camelid, a family of cud-chewing mammals that also includes alpacas and camels? There are two outfits offering such walks in the Ottawa region, Jock River Alpaca and Llama Farm in Richmond, Ont., and Serendipity Farm and Sanctuary in Lanark, Ont. ""They're kind of like potato chips. You can't just have one or two,"" said Ben Rabb, 19, who now owns 60 animals on a family property in Richmond, a half-hour drive southwest of Ottawa. The herd consists of 25 llamas and 35 alpacas, and clients can choose to walk either species. Rabb started offering llama and alpaca walks four years ago. ""It's just therapeutic,"" he said. ""You can talk to them and they listen, or they seem to."" Clients may request a specific animal or colour, but ultimately, they can expect to lead ""whichever ones are easiest to catch at the time — whoever's not out running around,"" said Rabb. ""For the most part, they're just like big dogs."" Rabb shut down the walks earlier on in the pandemic, but the timing worked out, as he and his partner are two of only a handful of skilled alpaca shearers in Ontario, and they spent April through June on the road. Since they reopened, business has been booming, up 25 per cent over last year, according to Rabb. Interestingly, llamas seem to be anti-maskers: according to Keith Adam of Serendipity Farm, they're uneasy around people who cover their face, be it with a winter scarf or surgical mask. ""We noticed it right away. All of a sudden their llama would be at arm's length,"" said Adam. ""If you've got a mask on, they can't get the full read of what you're like.""

13,Quebec's $100M mental health funding announcement pushed up in wake of sword attack in capital,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 10:42:02 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-city-sword-attack-mental-health-1.5785936?cmp=rss,Claire Loewen,"In his first public address since a sword attack that killed two people in Quebec's capital on Halloween, Premier François Legault says the province will invest more time and money into improving mental health services.  ""What happened on Saturday night is appalling,"" Legault said at a news conference Monday morning. ""It's hard to understand how such violence can occur. It raises questions about mental illness."" ""We can reduce the impacts for certain people who have mental illness by offering more services,"" he said.    When announcing details of $100 million in provincial funding for mental health services Monday afternoon, Lionel Carmant, Quebec's junior health minister, said he didn't want to draw any links between the pandemic's effects on people's mental health and the attack, but said the government was taking those effects seriously.   The funding announcement was expected next week, but was pushed ahead in light of the attacks.  On Sunday, 24-year-old Carl Girouard was charged with two counts of first-degree murder and five counts of attempted murder after allegedly attacking seven people in Old Quebec on Halloween night with a sword while dressed in a medieval outfit. He is expected back in court Thursday.  Carmant said he also wanted to make sure people don't confuse mental health issues with mental health illnesses, and said that people who experience either are rarely violent.  ""I think that what happened this weekend was unpredictable and that we can't make a definitive link to the pandemic."" A third of the $100 million in funding will go toward reducing wait lists for mental health services, both in public health and education settings. There are 16,000 people in line for mental health services, Carmant said.  Another third of the money will go to improving services in health facilities. Of the rest of the funding, $19 million will go to street workers who are part of a team called Sentinelle, whose role is to meet with vulnerable populations, and $10 million will go to community organizations providing mental health services.  Though experts say it is too soon to diagnose the suspect in the attacks, some drew comparisons to the trauma experienced in the wake of the Quebec City mosque shooting. Meanwhile, the province also moved to provide psychosocial supports for those affected by the attacks. Marc-André Lamontagne, a psychologist who interviewed the Quebec City mosque shooter over two days in 2018, said there are some commonalities between the two incidents, namely that they occurred in a public place and people were not expecting to be attacked.  ""But when it comes to motivation, what's hidden behind the act, the personal history — for now, we don't know enough to establish resemblance between the two cases,"" Lamontagne said.  University of Ottawa psychology professor Tracy Vaillancourt, who studies the links between mental health and violence as a Canada Tier 1 Research Chair, pointed out that the mosque shooting ""was a targeted event — it was directed at individuals because of their religion."" Police and provincial and municipal officials held a news conference Sunday morning, where Quebec City police said the suspect's actions show that he likely premeditated the attack, but that the victims were chosen at random. They said Girouard does not have a criminal record, but the suspect did reveal five years ago in a ""medical context"" that he wanted to commit a violent act. Vaillancourt said that past history is a better indicator of the likelihood someone would commit a violent act, rather than mental health issues.  Describing mental illness as the ""biggest safety concern"" in major Canadian cities for decades to come, Quebec City Mayor Régis Labeaume said during Sunday's news conference that it is becoming increasingly difficult for authorities to manage. Quebec Public Security Minister Geneviève Guilbault echoed Labeaume's call for public discussion about mental health Sunday, calling it ""a major issue that has perhaps been too long and too often forgotten."" Manon Massé, co-spokesperson for Québec Solidaire, said COVID-19 public health restrictions ""are causing even more distress"" than usual.  Liberal Leader Dominique Anglade said the question of mental health is ""at the heart of what we do."" Monday evening, Labeaume held a news conference saying he welcomed the $100-million investment from the provincial government, but was calling for a debate about how mental health services are administered in the province. ""People want to know what innovations there are in how we intervene in mental health; what other places are doing; whether we're doing things the right way, and can we re-discuss existing laws? People want to understand why mental health feels like a bigger problem than it was 10 or 20 years ago,"" Labeaume said.  Quebec City's regional health authority is sending an intervention team to provide psychosocial support to citizens of Old Quebec on Monday from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the corner of Hébert and Remparts streets, near where the attacks occurred. The Info-Social 811 line is also available to answer calls for people who need support.  Labeaume will offer a message of reassurance and comfort to students at the Collège François-de-Laval and the École des Ursulines in Old Quebec, which are also near the scene of Saturday's attack. Psychological support staff will also be sent to the schools. Labeaume said the sword attack reminded him of the mosque shooting that took place at the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre just under four years ago in his city.  Mohamed Labidi, founder and president of the Quebec Islamic Cultural Centre, said he was also reminded of the 2017 attack.  ""These were gratuitous attacks which should never have taken place,"" Labidi said, offering his condolences to the families of the victims.   He said addressing mental health issues is extremely important.  ""The more we address these issues, the more we will have a peaceful society.""

15,Canadian soldier killed in Netherlands in WWII identified,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 13:28:58 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/canadian-soldier-identified-1.5786327?cmp=rss,Wallis Snowdon,"An unknown Canadian soldier who lay buried for decades in the Netherlands has been identified as an Alberta-born man killed in action as the Second World War drew to a close. And the search for his final resting place has reunited the soldier's relatives with the man who stood beside him on the battlefield as he died. Trooper Henry George Johnston's identity was confirmed under a program dedicated to identifying newly found skeletal remains and Canadian service members buried in nameless graves, the Defence Department said in a statement Monday. Johnston was buried as an unknown soldier in 1945 in the Commonwealth War Graves Commission's Mook War Cemetery in Limburg province, a final resting place for more than 300 soldiers killed in the Second World War. National Defence Canada said a headstone rededication ceremony will take place at the grave in Mook. The son of Wilbert and Adaline Johnston, Henry George ""Archie"" Johnston was born on May 2, 1915, in Chauvin, Alta., 265 kilometres southeast of Edmonton. Johnston married Amelia Alice in spring 1939, and together they had five children.  He supported the family working at a saw mill in Chinook Valley. He enlisted in 1943 and arrived in the United Kingdom in July 1944.  He was declared killed in action on Jan. 17, 1945, during a battle that was part of Operation Blackcock, an effort to clear German troops from the Roer Triangle during fighting on the Western Front.  He was 29 years old.  Johnston's regiment — 1st Armoured Personnel Carrier Regiment — was nicknamed the Kangaroos as the unit was charged with transporting infantry soldiers in armoured vehicles called Kangaroos. Johnston was killed near Susteren in the province of Limburg in the southeastern part of the Netherlands on the night of Jan. 16 as his company came under heavy shelling. The regiment, along with a squadron of tanks, had temporarily broken away from the rest of the troops in an attempt to offset the threat of heavy counterattacks.   ""While the men dove under their vehicles for protection, five were injured and Trooper Johnston, a Kangaroo gunner and radio operator, was hit and killed,"" reads Johnston's biography on the National Defence website.  In 2018, a researcher contacted the Defence officials, revealing new details about the grave. The following year — after an exhaustive review of archival sources including war diaries, casualty register cards and exhumation reports — the Canadian Armed Forces confirmed the identity of the grave.  Archival evidence was found that proved that the date of death on the original grave marker was incorrect. Documents were found that showed the grave was originally located near Baakhaven before being relocated to the Mook War Cemetery. Gord Krebs said Monday's announcement followed years of historical research and a series of coincidences that brought closure to two Alberta families. Krebs's wife, Dennise Krebs, is Johnston's granddaughter. Ellen Rowe, her mother, is Johnston's daughter. Krebs and his wife were going to Paris on business in 2012. Before they departed, Rowe encouraged them to find Johnston's grave. They had military records suggesting Johnston had been buried in Groesbeek Canadian War Cemetery, so they took an afternoon trip on the bullet train to pay their respects. They didn't realize until they got to the cemetery that Johnston was considered missing in action. A man walking the grounds helped them find the soldier's name on a large memorial plaque. The stranger accompanied them to the local war museum and introduced them to the archivists on staff. The museum staff promised to do what they could to help them find Johnston's gravesite. He left them his email address.  ""By the time we left and went back to Canada, I had 35 emails from people all over Europe, trying to help us and the last email said, 'There's a guy in Calgary, Canada.'"" Krebs was provided the contact for Bill Miller in Calgary. He was told Miller was a military enthusiast and might have the answers he was looking for. A few weeks later, after returning home to Didsbury, Alta., Krebs gave Miller a call. Miller had been waiting for the call for decades. ""He answered the phone and I said, 'I'm not a telemarketer or anything like that. I'm just looking for some information on my wife's grandfather. His name was Trooper Henry George Johnston.' ""And literally, I heard his chair fall over and he dropped the phone on the floor. ""And he said, 'You've got to be kidding me.'  He said, 'I've been looking for your family for 50 years."" Miller's father, Bill Miller Sr., was in the same tank crew as Johnston. The senior Miller, who has since died, had been haunted for decades by his memories of Johnston's death. The men were dear friends and when Johnston was blown apart by German shells, Miller was asked to gather his remains and bring them back from the front.  ""They drove the tank together and he was standing right beside Henry when he got killed,"" Krebs said. ""And at the time, it was like a big brother-little brother relationship so it was really hard on Bill. ""He was really torn up about it and basically affected the rest of his life."" In the months that followed, Miller and the Johnston families grew close, sharing records and old photographs. The following September, Johnston's surviving children met with Miller at Krebs's home where they pored over old service records. Just as Miller pulled up the driveway, Krebs found an old photograph of Johnston in uniform with his fellow soldiers. Inscribed on the back was the name Bill Miller. ""I grabbed that picture and I walked down the driveway to introduce myself to Bill. ""He stops and starts crying right there in my driveway because he said, for 15 years, he started the search looking for a picture of his dad in uniform and he never found one."" After that meeting, Miller and Ivo Wilms, a researcher in Holland, continued their search for the gravesite.  Miller said his father rarely spoke about the war, even before Alzheimer's began to rob him of his memories.  ""It was not something he ever really discussed, but he really did make a point of making sure that I knew about Henry,"" Miller said, his voice breaking. ""They were best friends.""  Miller said the gravesite was identified thanks to strange coincidence and burial records unearthed in 2018. In the chaos of the front, Johnston's grave had been marked as that of an identified British soldier.  When the remains were exhumed so they could be interred at the war cemetery in Mook, a bracelet was found. The bracelet belonged to a Canadian soldier from Winnipeg who had served in Johnston's regiment but had survived the war. It was the clue Miller needed to launch an exhaustive process of elimination. ""I'm over-the-moon ecstatic that this has finally come about,"" he said. ""If I had any regrets, I wish that this had happened, you know, 75 years ago. So many of the people that really needed closure, they're all passed away."" "
16,Sajjan grilled over delay in protecting victims' rights in military law,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 16:32:42 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/sajjan-victims-rights-military-law-1.5786796?cmp=rss,Murray Brewster,"The federal government is determined to consult with victims of misconduct before fully enshrining victims' rights in Canadian military law, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told a House of Commons committee today. It's been over a year since Parliament passed legislation to insert a victims' bill of rights into the separate but distinct justice system of the Armed Forces, but it has yet to come into force because new regulations have not yet been drafted. ""I wish these regulations could be done almost immediately, but we also committed to consulting with the victims so that the regulations are done appropriately,"" Sajjan said during a virtual appearance before the Commons justice committee. ""This is something we committed to and we need to make sure that we do it well."" In a media statement, the defence department's legal branch said today that it has conducted a series of consultations with various organizations, including the military's Sexual Misconduct Response Center (SMRC), its External Advisory Council — ""[of] which the founder of the [victim's rights] group It's Just 700 is a member"" — the Department of Justice's policy centre and the Federal Ombudsman for Victims of Crime. The statement acknowledges that individual victims have not yet been asked for input but plans are being made for an online survey. Marie-Claude Gagnon is the head of It's Just 700, which represents survivors of sexual misconduct in the Canadian military. She said her two-year term on the external advisory council expired in March and, to her knowledge, no one has been appointed to replace her or speak for victims. She also said she was not aware of any planned consultations with victims, online or otherwise. ""If there had been a sense of emergency to enshrine rights to victims, it could have been written by now and it could have been done with proper consultation with military victims,"" said Marie-Claude Gagnon of It's Just 700, the group that spearheaded a class action lawsuit against the federal government in response to decades of sexual violence and harassment in the ranks. ""Looking at how the Declaration of Victim's Rights in the National Defence Act was drafted, without any consultation with military victims, we know that delays do not necessarily equate to better and proper consultation with military victims."" That declaration was drafted without input from those who had suffered injury and injustice in military service. Gagnon said victims were promised a voice in the drafting of regulations as Bill C-77 — the legislation containing the promise of victims' rights — passed the Senate. More than a year afterward, Gagnon said victims are frustrated. ""I don't understand how the Canadian military judicial process has been able to go on for so long, unchecked,"" she said Monday. A victims' bill of rights that spells out (among other things) the need for the justice system to consult with those affected by crime has been a fixture in civilian courts for years. Its absence in military law has been the subject of debate for just as long. The former Conservative government tried and failed to correct the oversight, but the legislation did not pass before the 2015 election. New Democrat defence critic Randall Garrison told the committee the Liberal government has no excuses left and that regulations and consultations should be complete by now. WATCH: Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan on victims' rights ""Can you tell us when those regulations will be done? And 'soon' is not a good enough answer. We've been waiting a year for those regulations. So what's the holdup?"" Garrison asked. Sajjan said he was unable to offer a timeline. ""We are working, I can assure you, as quickly as possible,"" the minister said, noting that he had spoken to the military's judge advocate general ""many times"" about the issue. ""The regulations have to be written in a way that has impact. That impact can only happen if we continually consult with the victims themselves so we can get this right."" At least one military legal expert has said the will of Parliament is being flouted by the defence department through its inability to put a law in place that has been passed already. "
17,How close can you get with masks on? Your mask questions answered,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 04:00:00 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/ask-covid-mask-questions-1.5782108?cmp=rss,"Emily Chung,Kieran McMurchy,Tyler Bloomfield,Cheryl Brown","We're answering your questions about the pandemic. Send yours to COVID@cbc.ca, and we'll answer as many as we can. We publish a selection of answers online and also put some questions to the experts during The National and on CBC News Network. So far, we've received more than 55,000 emails from all corners of the country. Most of us are wearing masks a lot, and winter is approaching. That's led CBC readers to send us new, more detailed and more seasonal questions about wearing masks to protect against the spread of COVID-19. We checked in with experts for the answers. (You can also check out our previous mask FAQs, including questions such as: Is heat needed to clean reusable masks? Can I use a mouth shield instead of a mask? And can I reuse disposable masks?) Yes, distancing is still required, as regular medical and non-medical masks only reduce the number of particles from your nose and mouth. They don't eliminate them, says Dr. Anand Kumar, associate professor of medicine at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg. (Respirator masks such as N95s do a much better job of filtering particles.) While most masks reduce particle spread by about 80 per cent, ""that leaves 20 per cent of particles still going out. How far? Nobody really knows,"" he told CBC News. But the greater the distance, the greater the protection, whether you're wearing a mask or not. Doubling the distance between you and another person reduces the viral particles reaching you about eightfold, Kumar said. And wearing a mask should cause the larger, most-infectious particles to drop close to an infected mask wearer before they can reach another person. So, how close can you get if you're both wearing masks? There's no definite answer, says Martin Fischer, an associate professor of chemistry at Duke University in Durham, N.C., who has studied how to measure the effectiveness of different masks. That's because the risks depend on so many factors, such as how well the masks worn by each person stop particles and how long you interact. Kumar and other experts note that approaches such as masking and distancing should be thought of as ""layers"" of protection that are ""worn"" together and aren't replacements for one another. ""It's not one or the other ... it's as many as you can do that gives you maximum protection."" Ian McKay, an Australian virologist, illustrates this using the analogy of Swiss cheese — the virus can make it through the holes in some slices, but if you have many layers, it won't get through the whole block of cheese. A new version with colour &amp; division inspiration from <a href=""https://twitter.com/UQ_News?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@uq_news</a> and strict mouse design oversight by <a href=""https://twitter.com/kat_arden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@kat_arden</a> (ver3.0).<br>It reorganises slices into personal &amp; shared responsibilities (think of this in terms of all the slices rather than any single layer being most important) <a href=""https://t.co/nNwLWZTWOL"">pic.twitter.com/nNwLWZTWOL</a> That's probably not a good idea. Canada's chief public health officer has advised Canadians to skip kissing and wear a mask when getting intimate with a new partner to protect yourself from the coronavirus. If you lean in very close — like you would for a kiss — you could unintentionally exchange droplets from breath around the sides of a mask, explained Colin Furness, an infection control epidemiologist at the University of Toronto, which could lead to transmission of the virus.  With many parts of the country experiencing increased community transmission, Sumon Chakrabarti, an infectious disease physician with Trillium Health Partners in Mississauga, Ont., said it is best to follow local public health guidelines, which include minimizing close contact with people outside your immediate household. WATCH | Doctors answer questions about what activities and places are higher risk for COVID-19 It depends on the mask. There are two main categories of masks: Respirators such as N95s, which do protect the wearer and are therefore worn by medical staff who treat COVID-19 patients.  Regular surgical or non-medical masks, which are designed mainly to stop particles exhaled from your nose or mouth from getting too far from you. Studies show that those regular masks are very good at filtering particles leaving the mouth and nose of the wearer, as they tend to block larger particles more effectively. That's how they protect the people around you if you're infected. But yes, there is some evidence that they can protect the wearer, too, including a metanalysis of 172 previous studies published this spring. Lab experiments suggest they can block roughly 80 per cent of viral particles from entering your nose and mouth, and that can reduce the dose and therefore the severity of COVID-19 infection if you do become infected.  There's even better evidence that when most people wear masks, everyone is protected.  ""We're seeing, as we put all the data together, that masks can be broadly helpful in reducing transmission from person to person outside of health-care settings and even just in the general community,"" said Dr. Suzy Hota, medical director for infection prevention and control at the University Health Network in Toronto. At 🇺🇸 state level, the % of people knowing someone with <a href=""https://twitter.com/hashtag/covid19?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">#covid19</a> symptoms vs. % wearing masks has a tight negative correlation.<br>Other drivers may be involved, but this is compelling.<br><br>A powerful argument for wearing a mask, in visual form | <a href=""https://twitter.com/_cingraham?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@_cingraham</a> <a href=""https://t.co/ClnbCs2Xp7"">https://t.co/ClnbCs2Xp7</a> <a href=""https://t.co/Es6FSI2PDE"">pic.twitter.com/Es6FSI2PDE</a> That depends on whether you're breathing, talking, sneezing or coughing. Shouting, cheering and singing all produce more droplets than breathing or talking, and those particles come mainly out your mouth. And coughing, mainly from your mouth, can propel droplets more than two metres. But sneezing can propel particles, mainly from your nose, up to eight metres, studies show. On the other hand, it's not just the quantity of droplets that matters but also how infectious they are. Studies of COVID-19 patients have found higher amounts of virus in the nose than in the throat. WATCH | Can I leave my mask under my chin when not using it? No. Wearing a mask below your nose defeats its purpose. That's because masks and face coverings are supposed to reduce coronavirus-spreading respiratory droplets, and the virus can both exit (see previous question) and enter via your nose. In places where masks are mandatory, policies usually specify that they need to cover your nose. For example, Quebec's regulation says a mask needs to cover the nose and mouth while Ontario's says it needs to cover the mouth, nose and chin. The only thing less effective than wearing your mask below your nose is <a href=""https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@Twitter</a>'s ""report fake account"" button<br><br>Remember: misinformation exists, but so does reliable info about properly wearing masks via <a href=""https://twitter.com/GovCanHealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@GovCanHealth</a> <a href=""https://twitter.com/ONThealth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"">@ONThealth</a> &amp; your public health unit. <a href=""https://t.co/5mvngDeqfr"">https://t.co/5mvngDeqfr</a> <a href=""https://t.co/blcH3XyVsj"">pic.twitter.com/blcH3XyVsj</a> Generally, yes, they're permitted as face coverings under mandatory mask bylaws as long as they cover the required parts of your face (see previous question). However, you should check your local region's guidelines, as this isn't the case everywhere. For example, Quebec's health ministry told CBC News in an email that it requires face coverings to be properly fitted to your face and have at least two layers, so loose scarves or neck warmers are not acceptable.  Newfoundland and Labrador's health ministry notes that scarves and other cloth face coverings may be less effective than non-medical masks. Quebec's health ministry warns that droplets could pass through the openings in a loose scarf. Fischer's study in September showed that many scarves, balaclavas, bandanas, neck fleeces and neck gaiters are not very effective at blocking respiratory droplets compared to masks as they're too thin or porous. In fact, some neck fleeces and neck gaiters tend to break large droplets into smaller ones, creating more particles that stayed airborne longer and potentially increasing viral transmission. Scarves and neck warmers also generally don't meet the recommendations that the Public Health Agency of Canada has for face coverings, such as fitting securely to the head with ties or ear loops and being made of at least two layers of tightly woven material fabric, such as cotton or linen.  Toronto Public Health recommends that when wearing a face covering that doesn't cover the mouth, nose or chin without gaps a face mask should be worn underneath. WATCH | Are you making these face mask mistakes? Multiple experts we talked to said it's not really known whether masks are less effective when damp or frozen. However, when it comes to N95 masks, the electrostatic filter stops functioning if it gets soaking wet, says Dr. Allison McGeer, infectious diseases specialist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital. Regardless of whether filtering abilities are affected, damp or frozen masks tend to be more difficult to breathe through, notes Conor Ruzycki, a University of Alberta doctoral candidate in Edmonton who has done research on the filtration abilities of homemade masks.  Wet masks can also provide an environment for bacteria to grow, he and other experts said. ""For these reasons, it's a good idea to replace a wet or frozen mask with a fresh and dry one,"" added Ruzycki, who volunteers with Masks4Canada, a group that advocates for mandatory mask laws. ""With winter coming, consider carrying an extra mask or two to change into if you find your mask freezing up or becoming water-logged."" WATCH | How to wear and care for masks Yes, if they're clean. ""Sharing masks is not risky if they are well washed,"" said Furness. Health Canada recommends washing them on a hot cycle and then drying thoroughly. But even with good laundering, Dr. Sumon Chakrabarti noted that masks are pretty intimate items to be swapping with others. ""Think about it like sharing well-washed underwear,"" Chakrabarti said. ""Safe, yes. Gross, also yes."" As masks are so widely available now, he said it's a better option to use your own.  That's unlikely if you keep your masks clean and change them as needed, experts say. But if you allow them to get damp and don't change or clean them, then wear them for a long time, bacteria can grow in them (but not viruses, which can't reproduce outside the body.)  That can cause masks to get smelly but wouldn't necessarily be harmful, says Kumar. However, Furness has previously said that studies have found that wearing the same mask all day can lead to an increase in respiratory infections. In general, public health officials recommend changing masks when they become damp or dirty. Some CBC readers have also written in worrying that wearing masks could reduce oxygen levels or cause a buildup of carbon dioxide, but experts say there's no evidence that they can do that. WATCH | Masks and oxygen levels It's not so straightforward. Cara Zwibel, a lawyer for the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, says that an argument could be made under freedom of expression. ""Like with any piece of clothing, there's this argument that people use what they wear and their appearance to express who they are,"" said Zwibel. But when it comes to charter rights, the government can restrict them if they do so in a way that is reasonable and justified. ""Given the circumstances of the pandemic and the importance of the objective of curbing the spread of COVID-19, a mere preference not to wear a mask likely would not be protected,"" said Joanna Baron, executive director of the Canadian Constitution Foundation in Calgary. a non-profit organization that argues charter cases in court. For someone who says they are unable to wear a mask for medical reasons, Zwibel says, it depends on the situation, but a case could be made under equality rights. ""If someone was treated differently or couldn't access a government service because of a medical issue that precluded them from wearing a mask, then there would be a potential equality issue."" First, you should approach the customer and ask if they have a medical reason for not being able to wear a mask. If they say they do, you'll have to take their word for it. ""A mere statement by an individual that they qualify for an exemption from a mandatory mask order is sufficient. They do not need to produce medical proof,"" Baron said. The Ontario Human Rights Commission recommends everyone involved should be flexible in the situation and explore whether individual accommodation would suffice. What that accommodation might look like would vary based on the type of business or service, the medical reason precluding the customer from wearing a mask and the current government directives during the pandemic. It could be something as simple as a curbside pickup arrangement. WATCH | How to stay safe from COVID-19 on a plane For any setting, including an airplane, the Public Health Agency of Canada recommends any mask that covers the nose and mouth, can be secured to the head comfortably, allows for easy breathing and does not require frequent adjustment. According to the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority website passengers must wear coverings that are properly secured and cover the mouth and nose and are made of at least two layers of tightly woven fabric, such as cotton or linen, which most on the market are. Here's what types of face coverings you don't want to show up to the airport with: A face shield without a proper mask underneath. A mask with an exhalation valve or vent. Neck gaiters or bandanas. Militaristic masks such as gas masks. Face coverings that cover the entire face.  Ruzycki says properly fitted N95 respirators do provide more protection against airborne particles than regular cloth or surgical masks, but he doesn't recommend them because the risk of COVID-19 transmission on an airplane is relatively low where everyone is wearing masks and there is a shortage of N95 masks. ""Until we can guarantee that health care and frontline workers who face constant exposure to SARS-CoV-2 have regular and consistent access to N95 respirators, it's a good idea for the public to use well-designed and well-fitted cloth and surgical masks."" Some studies have also shown that N95 masks are uncomfortable when worn for long periods of time, he said, especially if you're not used to them. "
18,Hundreds of women notified of class-action suit against Samson Cree,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 08:00:00 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/samson-cree-bill-c-31-alberta-court-class-action-1.5782079?cmp=rss,Andrea Huncar,"Bonnie Bruno's mother lost her Indian status and membership with Samson Cree Nation when she married the non-status man she loved.  Four decades later, Bruno's pursuit of justice could benefit more than 400 Indigenous women and their children in similar circumstances. They're being notified this month that they are part of a new class-action lawsuit that challenges decades of discrimination they have faced from their own First Nation. ""It shouldn't have had to come down to this for me to have to sue my own band,"" Bruno told CBC News. ""I hope in future situations that it can be prevented."" Bruno, 39, grew up on the central Alberta reserve of Pigeon Lake 138A. It is a satellite community of roughly 500 residents and few services apart from an elementary school and recreation centre, and is partly governed by Samson Cree, 70 kilometres away. Oil and gas reserves at Pigeon Lake have generated billions of dollars in revenue for Samson Cree but Bruno says she was denied her fair share of payments distributed to band members. At 18, the band cut her a cheque for $1,600. Members her age received more than $100,000 based on monthly cash payments from oil revenues.  At 24, Bruno took legal action.  ""That's when I decided to fight for it, to get what was rightfully mine,"" Bruno said. ""It's not this chief and council I feel betrayed by, it's the past ones."" Indian Act still discriminates against First Nations women, says UN Human Rights Committee Her 14-year court battle is rooted in the discrimination against Indigenous women under the old Indian Act, which sought to assimilate Indigenous people through enfranchisement. Unlike men, women who married a non-status person lost Indian status, band membership and its benefits.  WATCH | Bonnie Bruno's legal battle: In 1985, the federal government aimed to resolve that inequity through Bill C-31. The controversial amendment retroactively restored registered status to enfranchised women. Like many bands, Samson Cree does not recognize the legislative change. Samson Cree argues that the unilateral move infringes on its Indigenous right to self-government.  On Aug. 31, Alberta's Court of Queen's Bench confirmed the constitutionality of Bill C-31 and authorized Bruno's case to proceed as a class action. The ruling also deemed illegal hundreds of contracts signed mostly in 1995 offering band membership in exchange for any claim to past payments. The Alberta court decision has reset the dynamics in a long-standing dispute, said lawyer Philip Tinkler, who has worked on the case for more than a decade. ""The Samson nation took the law into their own hands to deprive these women of the very protections that the legislation intended for them to have,"" Tinkler said. ""They need to begin a reconciliation process on this issue, and it won't happen until they can get accountability from the nation."" In a statement of defence filed on May 31, 2016, the band denied all allegations and challenged the constitutionality of Bill C-31. In an email to CBC News, Tibor Osvath, the lawyer representing Samson Cree, said that by 1995, the First Nation had recognized virtually all individuals who qualified for membership under Bill C-31 and afforded them full rights. ""This includes Ms. Bruno, who was not only recognized as a member of Samson Cree Nation in 1995 but also enjoyed many of the privileges and benefits of membership (such as residing in Samson Cree Nation-owned housing and Samson Cree Nation services) prior to 1995,"" Osvath wrote. Samson Cree will challenge the ruling at the Alberta Court of Appeal in June 2021. In a spacious new home on the Enoch Cree Nation where Amanda Lightning lives with her husband and children, a black and white photo hangs on the living room wall. It shows Lightning's beaming grandparents in their youth, his arm slung around her shoulder. Lightning's grandmother Maria was stripped of her Indian status and band membership at Samson Cree Nation after marrying Samuel Bruno, who didn't have status. Lightning was surprised to learn that because of what happened to the grandmother she called her kokum, she herself is part of the class-action lawsuit sparked by Bruno, her aunt. Lightning said that when her kokum lost her status, the effects trickled down through the family, leaving the next two generations to struggle with poverty, addiction and homelessness. Forced to live off reserve, Lightning said she had to ""assimilate to the colonized culture of city life"" in Edmonton — fitting into neither world. ""I felt very lost, hopeless and alone during that time,"" said Lightning, 37. ""I am only now beginning to make those connections again."" After completing her degree in social work, Lightning plans to devote her work to intergenerational healing. The legal ruling affirms her resolve to break the cycle.  ""It's healing for me, because I'm working really hard right now and breaking those generational curses,"" Lightning said. ""I'm hoping that all of those things stop with me and future generations, my kids and my grandkids — that they don't have to experience those things."" The August ruling overturns an earlier decision rejecting a class action on behalf of the same group of plaintiffs, upheld on appeal to the Federal Court of Appeal. The decision could also set a precedent for other bands that refuse to recognize membership of people who regain status through legislation such as Bill C-31. ""It's going to have a ripple effect across more than Samson Nation, for sure,"" Tinkler said. ""The membership may be entitled to pursue class proceedings against their First Nation."" In 2019, the final provisions came into force of another legislative amendment aimed at tackling remaining inequities of the Indian Act. In response to Bill S-3, some First Nations tightened their membership criteria. Indian status could be extended to hundreds of thousands as Bill S-3 provisions come into force The Native Women's Association of Canada said the court decision is another step in protecting the rights of Indigenous women. But ultimately, said NWAC lawyer Adam Bond, a holistic approach is needed to address the ways the Indian Act discriminates against women and infringes on the rights of Indigenous peoples.  ""We need to have a wholehearted and genuine approach to eliminating these types of discriminations,"" Bond said.

19,Blanchet seeks to drive values wedge between Quebec and Trudeau government,"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 11:54:17 EST",https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/blanchet-values-quebec-trudeau-1.5786269?cmp=rss,The Canadian Press,"Bloc Québécois Leader Yves-François Blanchet is doubling down on efforts to draw a line separating his party's values from those of the Trudeau Liberals — particularly on the fraught ground of free speech. Blanchet posted a tweet Sunday suggesting Justin Trudeau's response to attacks in France that authorities have attributed to Muslim extremists did not go far enough, and highlighted what the Bloc leader called a ""disturbing gap"" in values that he chalked up to possible ""weakness"" or ""ideology"" on the prime minister's part. Blanchet said in French that Trudeau is threatening Quebec's friendship with France. He's sought to align his province with that country's ""republican and secular"" principles, contrasting them with what he called an ""Anglo-Saxon multiculturalist doctrine."" The stern words compound Blanchet's criticism of the prime minister's reaction to a University of Ottawa professor's use of a notoriously derogatory word for Black people in class. Un écart troublant entre les valeurs portée par la doctrine multiculturaliste anglo-saxonne et celles, républicaines et laïques, de la Francophonie occidentale.<br>Le péril met à l’épreuve des amitiés et des alliances dans la foulée de ce vraisemblable échec du post-nationalisme. <a href=""https://t.co/katB1jo4un"">https://t.co/katB1jo4un</a> Last week, Trudeau condemned the attacks in France as ""heinous"" acts of terrorism that fly in the face of Canadian values and said Ottawa ""would always defend freedom of expression, but freedom of expression is not without limits."" ""In a pluralistic, diverse and respectful society like ours, we must be aware of the impact of our words, of our actions on others, particularly these communities and populations who still experience enormous discrimination,"" Trudeau told reporters in French on Friday. At a press conference today, Blanchet argued that Trudeau's comments suggested ""extenuating circumstances"" might explain some acts of terrorism. ""My duty is to tell our sisters and brothers and friends in France that Quebec does not share this opinion being expressed by the prime minister of Canada,"" Blanchet said. Three attacks in France over the past two months have come amid a growing furor over caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad that were republished by the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. Extremists attacked the Charlie Hebdo newsroom in January 2015, after the caricatures were first published, and killed 12 people. Since their reprinting in September at the start of the ongoing Paris trial over the killings, France has endured three attacks blamed on Muslim extremists. One saw two people injured outside the newspaper's old headquarters, allegedly by a teenage refugee from Pakistan. On Oct. 16, a teacher name Samuel Paty was beheaded outside his school for opening a class debate on free speech by showing students the caricatures. And on Thursday, a knife-wielding man attacked and killed three people in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice. At his press conference today, Blanchet accused the Trudeau government of being slow to condemn the attacks. Blanchet said Quebec's National Assembly passed a unanimous motion condemning the attack on Paty and lamented the fact that the House of Commons chose only to observe a moment of silence. Last month, the Bloc pushed the government for a response to a controversy over a university instructor's use of a racial slur in class, demanding that the Liberals state unequivocally whether they support the professor involved. Blanchet said those subjected to hateful words deserve compassion and support, but using the term in an educational context isn't bigoted. Trudeau had told the House of Commons that ""we all need to be conscious of the power of our words."" Blanchet spoke about freedom of expression at a news conference this afternoon ahead of a House vote on his motion demanding an apology from the government for having invoked the War Measures Act during the October Crisis in Quebec 50 years ago. That vote failed by a vote of 263 to 56. Liberal and Conservative MPs voted against the motion, while most NDP MPs joined their Bloc counterparts and voted in favour. In October 1970, the Liberal government under then-prime minister Pierre Trudeau chose to suspend civil liberties by invoking the statute then known as the War Measures Act in response to the kidnapping of a Quebec cabinet minister, Pierre Laporte, and a British diplomat by members of the militant FLQ separatist group. The move, which came at the request of the Quebec premier and Montreal's mayor, led to soldiers patrolling the streets as authorities rounded up hundreds of residents under suspicion of involvement in the abductions. The three Green MPs also voted in favour of the Bloc motion, despite a statement released by the party's leader, Annamie Paul, that criticized it for politicizing a tragic historical event.  ""If the objective of the motion is to produce healing and reconciliation related to the events of October, 1970, then it is wrong to introduce a motion that fails to mention the assassination of Mr. Laporte and the impact on his loved ones, does not mention the Quebecers who were injured and terrorised during the bombings attacks carried out during that period, nor acknowledge the role played by the government of Quebec in invoking the War Measures Act,"" said Paul. ""Likewise, in responding to the motion, it is wrong for the government to solely mention the horrific assassination of Mr. Laporte, without acknowledging the federal government's role in the arbitrary arrest and detention of innocent Quebecers under the War Measures Act."" Paul said she's proud of the Green Party's tradition of not whipping votes. Meanwhile, Quebec's highest court today began hearing a legal challenge to Quebec's secularism law — known as Bill 21 — which bans public school teachers, government lawyers and police officers, among other civil servants, from wearing religious symbols at work. Blanchet has been a steadfast supporter of the law, while opponents argue it disproportionately targets Muslim women and is therefore unconstitutional. "
